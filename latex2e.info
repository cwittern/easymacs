2 Overview of LaTeX
*******************

LaTeX is a system for typesetting documents.  It was originally created
by Leslie Lamport and is now maintained by a group of volunteers
(<http://latex-project.org>).  It is widely used, particularly for
complex and technical documents, such as those involving mathematics.

   A LaTeX user writes an input file containing text along with
interspersed commands, for instance commands describing how the text
should be formatted.  It is implemented as a set of related commands
that interface with Donald E. Knuth's TeX typesetting program (the
technical term is that LaTeX is a "macro package" for the TeX engine).
The user produces the output document by giving that input file to the
TeX engine.

   The term LaTeX is also sometimes used to mean the language in which
the document is marked up, that is, to mean the set of commands
available to a LaTeX user.

   The name LaTeX is short for "Lamport TeX".  It is pronounced LAH-teck
or LAY-teck, or sometimes LAY-tecks.  Inside a document, produce the
logo with '\LaTeX'.  Where use of the logo is not sensible, such as in
plain text, write it as 'LaTeX'.

* Output files::         Files produced.
* TeX engines::          Programs that can compile TeX and  LaTeX.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Starting and ending,  Next: Output files,  Up: Overview

2.1 Starting and ending
=======================

LaTeX files have a simple global structure, with a standard beginning
and ending.  Here is a "hello, world" example:

     \documentclass{article}
     \begin{document}
     Hello, \LaTeX\ world.
     \end{document}

Here, the 'article' is the so-called "document class", implemented in a
file 'article.cls'.  Any document class can be used.  A few document
classes are defined by LaTeX itself, and vast array of others are widely
available.  *Note Document classes::.

   You can include other LaTeX commands between the '\documentclass' and
the '\begin{document}' commands.  This area is called the "preamble".

   The '\begin{document} ... \end{document}' is a so-called
"environment"; the 'document' environment (and no others) is required in
all LaTeX documents (*note document::).  LaTeX provides many
environments itself, and many more are defined separately.  *Note
Environments::.

   The following sections discuss how to produce PDF or other output
from a LaTeX input file.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Output files,  Next: TeX engines,  Prev: Starting and ending,  Up: Overview

2.2 Output files
================

LaTeX produces a main output file and at least two accessory files.  The
main output file's name ends in either '.dvi' or '.pdf'.

'.dvi'
     If LaTeX is invoked with the system command 'latex' then it
     produces a DeVice Independent file, with extension '.dvi'.  You can
     view this file with a command such as 'xdvi', or convert it to a
     PostScript '.ps' file with 'dvips' or to a Portable Document Format
     '.pdf' file with 'dvipdfmx'.  The contents of the file can be
     dumped in human-readable form with 'dvitype'.  A vast array of
     other DVI utility programs are available
     (<http://mirror.ctan.org/tex-archive/dviware>).

'.pdf'
     If LaTeX is invoked via the system command 'pdflatex', among other
     commands (*note TeX engines::), then the main output is a Portable
     Document Format (PDF) file.  Typically this is a self-contained
     file, with all fonts and images included.

   LaTeX also produces at least two additional files.

'.log'
     This transcript file contains summary information such as a list of
     loaded packages.  It also includes diagnostic messages and perhaps
     additional information for any errors.

'.aux'
     Auxiliary information is used by LaTeX for things such as cross
     references.  For example, the first time that LaTeX finds a forward
     reference--a cross reference to something that has not yet appeared
     in the source--it will appear in the output as a doubled question
     mark '??'.  When the referred-to spot does eventually appear in the
     source then LaTeX writes its location information to this '.aux'
     file.  On the next invocation, LaTeX reads the location information
     from this file and uses it to resolve the reference, replacing the
     double question mark with the remembered location.

   LaTeX may produce yet more files, characterized by the filename
ending.  These include a '.lof' file that is used to make a list of
figures, a '.lot' file used to make a list of tables, and a '.toc' file
used to make a table of contents.  A particular class may create others;
the list is open-ended.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: TeX engines,  Next: LaTeX command syntax,  Prev: Output files,  Up: Overview

2.3 TeX engines
===============

LaTeX is defined to be a set of commands that are run by a TeX
implementation (*note Overview::).  This section gives a terse overview
of the main programs.

'latex'
'pdflatex'
     In TeX Live (<http://tug.org/texlive>), if LaTeX is invoked via
     either the system command 'latex' or 'pdflatex', then the pdfTeX
     engine is run (<http://ctan.org/pkg/pdftex>).  When invoked as
     'latex', the main output is a '.dvi' file; as 'pdflatex', the main
     output is a '.pdf' file.

     pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX extensions to Knuth's original
     program (<http://ctan.org/pkg/etex>), including additional
     programming features and bi-directional typesetting, and has plenty
     of extensions of its own.  e-TeX is available on its own as the
     system command 'etex', but this is plain TeX (and produces '.dvi').

     In other TeX distributions, 'latex' may invoke e-TeX rather than
     pdfTeX.  In any case, the e-TeX extensions can be assumed to be
     available in LaTeX.

'lualatex'
     If LaTeX is invoked via the system command 'lualatex', the LuaTeX
     engine is run (<http://ctan.org/pkg/luatex>).  This program allows
     code written in the scripting language Lua (<http://luatex.org>) to
     interact with TeX's typesetting.  LuaTeX handles UTF-8 Unicode
     input natively, can handle OpenType and TrueType fonts, and
     produces a '.pdf' file by default.  There is also 'dvilualatex' to
     produce a '.dvi' file, but this is rarely used.

'xelatex'
     If LaTeX is invoked with the system command 'xelatex', the XeTeX
     engine is run (<http://tug.org/xetex>).  Like LuaTeX, XeTeX
     natively supports UTF-8 Unicode and TrueType and OpenType fonts,
     though the implementation is completely different, mainly using
     external libraries instead of internal code.  XeTeX produces a
     '.pdf' file as output; it does not support DVI output.

     Internally, XeTeX creates an '.xdv' file, a variant of DVI, and
     translates that to PDF using the ('x')'dvipdfmx' program, but this
     process is automatic.  The '.xdv' file is only useful for
     debugging.

   Other variants of LaTeX and TeX exist, e.g., to provide additional
support for Japanese and other languages ([u]pTeX,
<http://ctan.org/pkg/ptex>, <http://ctan.org/pkg/uptex>).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: LaTeX command syntax,  Prev: TeX engines,  Up: Overview

2.4 LaTeX command syntax
========================

In the LaTeX input file, a command name starts with a backslash
character, '\'.  The name itself then consists of either (a) a string of
letters or (b) a single non-letter.

   LaTeX commands names are case sensitive so that '\pagebreak' differs
from '\Pagebreak' (the latter is not a standard command).  Most commands
are lowercase, but in any event you must enter all commands in the same
case as they are defined.

   A command may be followed by zero, one, or more arguments.  These
arguments may be either required or optional.  Required arguments are
contained in curly braces, '{...}'.  Optional arguments are contained in
square brackets, '[...]'.  Generally, but not universally, if the
command accepts an optional argument, it comes first, before any
required arguments.

   Inside of an optional argument, to use the character close square
bracket (']') hide it inside curly braces, as in '\item[closing bracket
{]}]'.  Similarly, if an optional argument comes last, with no required
argument after it, then to make the first character of the following
text be an open square bracket, hide it inside curly braces.

   LaTeX has the convention that some commands have a '*' form that is
related to the form without a '*', such as '\chapter' and '\chapter*'.
The exact difference in behavior varies from command to command.

   This manual describes all accepted options and '*'-forms for the
commands it covers (barring unintentional omissions, a.k.a. bugs).

* Menu:

* Environment::          Area of the source with distinct behavior.
* Declaration::          Change the value or meaning of a command.
* \makeatletter and \makeatother::    Change the status of the at-sign character.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Environment,  Next: Declaration,  Up: LaTeX command syntax

Synopsis:

     \begin{ENVIRONMENT NAME}
       ..
     \end{ENVIRONMENT NAME}

   An area of LaTeX source, inside of which there is a distinct
behavior.  For instance, for poetry in LaTeX put the lines between
'\begin{verse}' and '\end{verse}'.

     \begin{verse}
         There once was a man from Nantucket \\
          ..
     \end{verse}

   The ENVIRONMENT NAME at the beginning must exactly match that at the
end.  This includes the case where ENVIRONMENT NAME ends in a
star ('*'); both the '\begin' and '\end' texts must include the star.

   Environments may have arguments, including optional arguments.  This
example produces a table.  The first argument is optional (and causes
the table to be aligned on its top row) while the second argument is
required (it specifies the formatting of columns).

     \begin{tabular}[t]{r|l}
       .. rows of table ..
     \end{tabular}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Declaration,  Next: \makeatletter and \makeatother,  Prev: Environment,  Up: LaTeX command syntax

A command that changes the value, or changes the meaning, of some other
command or parameter.  For instance, the '\mainmatter' command changes
the setting of page numbers from roman numerals to arabic.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \makeatletter and \makeatother,  Prev: Declaration,  Up: LaTeX command syntax

Synopsis:

     \makeatletter
       ... definition of commands with @ in their name ..
     \makeatother

   Used to redefine internal LaTeX commands.  '\makeatletter' makes the
at-sign character '@' have the category code of a letter, 11.
'\makeatother' sets the category code of '@' to 12, its original value.

   As each character is read by TeX and LaTeX, it is assigned a
character code (for instance, the backslash '\' is assigned the
character code 0, for characters that start a command).  These two
commands alter the code assigned to '@'.

   The alteration is needed because many of LaTeX's commands use '@' in
their name, to prevent users from accidentally defining a command that
replaces one of LaTeX's own.  Command names consist of a category 0
character, ordinarily backslash, followed by letters, category 11
characters (except that a command name can consist of a single
category 0 character followed by a single non-letter symbol).  So under
the default category codes, user-defined commands cannot contain an '@'.
But '\makeatletter' and '\makeatother' allow users to define or redefine
commands named with '@'.

   Use these inside a '.tex' file, in the preamble.  Don't use them
inside '.sty' or '.cls' files since the '\documentclass' and
'\usepackage' commands set the at sign to have the character code of a
letter.

   The example code below, if put in the preamble, redefines the section
command to center the section title, put it in bold type, and adjust the
spacing.

     \makeatletter
     \renewcommand\section{\@startsection{section}% Name
                               {1}% Level: 0=part, 1=chapter, etc.
                               {0pt}% Heading indent
                               {-3.5ex plus -1ex minus -.2ex}% Beforeskip (if neg, no head indent)
                               {2.3ex plus.2ex}% Afterskip (if neg, run-in heading)
                               {\centering\normalfont\Large\bfseries}} % Style of head
     \makeatother

3 Document classes
******************

The document's overall class is defined with this command, which is
normally the first command in a LaTeX source file.

     \documentclass[OPTIONS]{CLASS}

   The following document CLASS names are built into LaTeX.  (Many other
document classes are available as separate packages; *note Overview::.)

'article'
     For a journal article, a presentation, and miscellaneous general
     use.

'book'
     Full-length books, including chapters and possibly including front
     matter, such as a preface, and back matter, such as an appendix
     (*note Front/back matter::).

'letter'
     Mail, optionally including mailing labels (*note Letters::).

'report'
     For documents of length between an 'article' and a 'book', such as
     technical reports or theses, which may contain several chapters.

'slides'
     For slide presentations--rarely used today.  In its place the
     'beamer' package is perhaps the most prevalent (*note beamer
     template::).

   Standard OPTIONS are described in the next section.

* Menu:

* Document class options::   Global options.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Document class options,  Up: Document classes

3.1 Document class options
==========================

You can specify so-called "global options" or "class options" to the
'\documentclass' command by enclosing them in square brackets.  To
specify more than one OPTION, separate them with a comma, as in:

     \documentclass[OPTION1,OPTION2,...]{CLASS}

   Here is the list of the standard class options.

   All of the standard classes except 'slides' accept the following
options for selecting the typeface size (default is '10pt'):

     10pt  11pt  12pt

   All of the standard classes accept these options for selecting the
paper size (these show height by width):

'a4paper'
     210 by 297 mm (about 8.25 by 11.75 inches)

'b5paper'
     176 by 250 mm (about 7 by 9.875 inches)

'executivepaper'
     7.25 by 10.5 inches

'legalpaper'
     8.5 by 14 inches

'letterpaper'
     8.5 by 11 inches (the default)

   When using one of the engines pdfLaTeX, LuaLaTeX, or XeLaTeX (*note
TeX engines::), options other than 'letterpaper' set the print area but
you must also set the physical paper size.  One way to do that is to put
'\pdfpagewidth=\paperwidth' and '\pdfpageheight=\paperheight' in your
document's preamble.  The 'geometry' package provides flexible ways of
setting the print area and physical page size.

   Miscellaneous other options:

'draft'
'final'
     Mark ('draft') or do not mark ('final') overfull boxes with a black
     box in the margin; default is 'final'.

'fleqn'
     Put displayed formulas flush left; default is centered.

'landscape'
     Selects landscape format; default is portrait.

'leqno'
     Put equation numbers on the left side of equations; default is the
     right side.

'openbib'
     Use "open" bibliography format.

'titlepage'
'notitlepage'
     Specifies whether there is a separate page for the title
     information and for the abstract also, if there is one.  The
     default for the 'report' class is 'titlepage', for the other
     classes it is 'notitlepage'.

   The following options are not available with the 'slides' class.

'onecolumn'
'twocolumn'
     Typeset in one or two columns; default is 'onecolumn'.

'oneside'
'twoside'
     Selects one- or two-sided layout; default is 'oneside', except that
     in the 'book' class the default is 'twoside'.

     For one-sided printing, the text is centered on the page.  For
     two-sided printing, the '\evensidemargin' ('\oddsidemargin')
     parameter determines the distance on even (odd) numbered pages
     between the left side of the page and the text's left margin, with
     '\oddsidemargin' being 40% of the difference between '\paperwidth'
     and '\textwidth', and '\evensidemargin' is the remainder.

'openright'
'openany'
     Determines if a chapter should start on a right-hand page; default
     is 'openright' for 'book', and 'openany' for 'report'.

   The 'slides' class offers the option 'clock' for printing the time at
the bottom of each note.

   Additional packages are loaded like this:

     \usepackage[OPTIONS]{PKG}

   To specify more than one package, you can separate them with a comma,
as in '\usepackage{PKG1,PKG2,...}', or use multiple '\usepackage'
commands.

   Any options given in the '\documentclass' command that are unknown by
the selected document class are passed on to the packages loaded with
'\usepackage'.

4 Fonts
*******

Two important aspects of selecting a "font" are specifying a size and a
style.  The LaTeX commands for doing this are described here.

* Menu:

* Font styles::                 Select roman, italics, etc.
* Font sizes::                  Select point size.
* Low-level font commands::     Select encoding, family, series, shape.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Font styles,  Next: Font sizes,  Up: Fonts

4.1 Font styles
===============

The following type style commands are supported by LaTeX.

   This first group of commands is typically used with an argument, as
in '\textit{TEXT}'.  In the table below, the corresponding command in
parenthesis is the "declaration form", which takes no arguments, as in
'{\itshape TEXT}'.  The scope of the declaration form lasts until the
next type style command or the end of the current group.

   These commands, in both the argument form and the declaration form,
are cumulative; e.g., you can say either '\sffamily\bfseries' or
'\bfseries\sffamily' to get bold sans serif.

   You can alternatively use an environment form of the declarations;
for instance, '\begin{ttfamily}...\end{ttfamily}'.

   These font-switching commands automatically insert italic corrections
if needed.  (*Note \/::, for the details of italic corrections.)
Specifically, they insert the italic correction unless the following
character is in the list '\nocorrlist', which by default consists of a
period and a comma.  To suppress the automatic insertion of italic
correction, use '\nocorr' at the start or end of the command argument,
such as '\textit{\nocorr text}' or '\textsc{text \nocorr}'.

'\textrm (\rmfamily)'
     Roman.

'\textit (\itshape)'
     Italics.

'\textmd (\mdseries)'
     Medium weight (default).

'\textbf (\bfseries)'
     Boldface.

'\textup (\upshape)'
     Upright (default).

'\textsl (\slshape)'
     Slanted.

'\textsf (\sffamily)'
     Sans serif.

'\textsc (\scshape)'
     Small caps.

'\texttt (\ttfamily)'
     Typewriter.

'\textnormal (\normalfont)'
     Main document font.

   Although it also changes fonts, the '\emph{TEXT}' command is
semantic, for text to be emphasized, and should not be used as a
substitute for '\textit'.  For example, '\emph{START TEXT \emph{MIDDLE
TEXT} END TEXT}' will result in the START TEXT and END TEXT in italics,
but MIDDLE TEXT will be in roman.

   LaTeX also provides the following commands, which unconditionally
switch to the given style, that is, are _not_ cumulative.  Also, they
are used differently than the above commands: '{\CMD...}' instead of
'\CMD{...}'.  These are two unrelated constructs.

'\bf'
     Switch to bold face.

'\cal'
     Switch to calligraphic letters for math.

'\it'
     Italics.

'\rm'
     Roman.

'\sc'
     Small caps.

'\sf'
     Sans serif.

'\sl'
     Slanted (oblique).

'\tt'
     Typewriter (monospace, fixed-width).

   The '\em' command is the unconditional version of '\emph'.

   (Some people consider the unconditional font-switching commands, such
as '\tt', obsolete and that only the cumulative commands ('\texttt')
should be used.  Others think that both sets of commands have their
place and sometimes an unconditional font switch is precisely what you
want; for one example, *note 'description': description.)

   The following commands are for use in math mode.  They are not
cumulative, so '\mathbf{\mathit{SYMBOL}}' does not create a boldface and
italic SYMBOL; instead, it will just be in italics.  This is because
typically math symbols need consistent typographic treatment, regardless
of the surrounding environment.

'\mathrm'
     Roman, for use in math mode.

'\mathbf'
     Boldface, for use in math mode.

'\mathsf'
     Sans serif, for use in math mode.

'\mathtt'
     Typewriter, for use in math mode.

'\mathit'
'(\mit)'
     Italics, for use in math mode.

'\mathnormal'
     For use in math mode, e.g., inside another type style declaration.

'\mathcal'
     Calligraphic letters, for use in math mode.

   In addition, the command '\mathversion{bold}' can be used for
switching to bold letters and symbols in formulas.
'\mathversion{normal}' restores the default.

   Finally, the command '\oldstylenums{NUMERALS}' will typeset so-called
"old-style" numerals, which have differing heights and depths (and
sometimes widths) from the standard "lining" numerals, which all have
the same height as upper-case letters.  LaTeX's default fonts support
this, and will respect '\textbf' (but not other styles; there are no
italic old-style numerals in Computer Modern).  Many other fonts have
old-style numerals also; sometimes the 'textcomp' package must be
loaded, and sometimes package options are provided to make them the
default.  FAQ entry:
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=osf>.

4.2 Font sizes
==============

The following standard type size commands are supported by LaTeX.  The
table shows the command name and the corresponding actual font size used
(in points) with the '10pt', '11pt', and '12pt' document size options,
respectively (*note Document class options::).

Command                   '10pt'  '11pt'  '12pt'
--------------------------------------------------
'\tiny'                   5       6       6
'\scriptsize'             7       8       8
'\footnotesize'           8       9       10
'\small'                  9       10      10.95
'\normalsize' (default)   10      10.95   12
'\large'                  12      12      14.4
'\Large'                  14.4    14.4    17.28
'\LARGE'                  17.28   17.28   20.74
'\huge'                   20.74   20.74   24.88
'\Huge'                   24.88   24.88   24.88

   The commands as listed here are "declaration forms".  The scope of
the declaration form lasts until the next type style command or the end
of the current group.  You can also use the environment form of these
commands; for instance, '\begin{tiny}...\end{tiny}'.

4.3 Low-level font commands
===========================

These commands are primarily intended for writers of macros and
packages.  The commands listed here are only a subset of the available
ones.

'\fontencoding{ENCODING}'
     Select the font encoding, the encoding of the output font.  There
     are a large number of valid encodings.  The most common are 'OT1',
     Knuth's original encoding for Computer Modern (the default), and
     'T1', also known as the Cork encoding, which has support for the
     accented characters used by the most widespread European languages
     (German, French, Italian, Polish and others), which allows TeX to
     hyphenate words containing accented letters.

'\fontfamily{FAMILY}'
     Select the font family.  The web page
     <http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/> provides one way to browse
     through many of the fonts easily used with LaTeX.  Here are
     examples of some common families:

          'pag'  Avant Garde
          'fvs'  Bitstream Vera Sans
          'pbk'  Bookman
          'bch'  Charter
          'ccr'  Computer Concrete
          'cmr'  Computer Modern
          'pcr'  Courier
          'phv'  Helvetica
          'fi4'  Inconsolata
          'lmr'  Latin Modern
          'lmss' Latin Modern Sans
          'lmtt' Latin Modern Typewriter
          'pnc'  New Century Schoolbook
          'ppl'  Palatino
          'ptm'  Times
          'uncl' Uncial
          'put'  Utopia
          'pzc'  Zapf Chancery

'\fontseries{SERIES}'
     Select the font series.  A "series" combines a "weight" and a
     "width".  Typically, a font supports only a few of the possible
     combinations.  Some common combined series values include:

          'm'  Medium (normal)
          'b'  Bold
          'c'  Condensed
          'bc' Bold condensed
          'bx' Bold extended

     The possible values for weight, individually, are:

          'ul' Ultra light
          'el' Extra light
          'l'  Light
          'sl' Semi light
          'm'  Medium (normal)
          'sb' Semi bold
          'b'  Bold
          'eb' Extra bold
          'ub' Ultra bold

     The possible values for width, individually, are (the percentages
     are just guides and are not followed precisely by all fonts):

          'uc' Ultra condensed, 50%
          'ec' Extra condensed, 62.5%
          'c'  Condensed, 75%
          'sc' Semi condensed, 87.5%
          'm'  Medium, 100%
          'sx' Semi expanded, 112.5%
          'x'  Expanded, 125%
          'ex' Extra expanded, 150%
          'ux' Ultra expanded, 200%

     When forming the SERIES string from the weight and width, drop the
     'm' that stands for medium weight or medium width, unless both
     weight and width are 'm', in which case use just one (''m'').

'\fontshape{SHAPE}'
     Select font shape.  Valid shapes are:

          'n'  Upright (normal)
          'it' Italic
          'sl' Slanted (oblique)
          'sc' Small caps
          'ui' Upright italics
          'ol' Outline

     The two last shapes are not available for most font families, and
     small caps are often missing as well.

'\fontsize{SIZE}{SKIP}'
     Set the font size and the line spacing.  The unit of both
     parameters defaults to points ('pt').  The line spacing is the
     nominal vertical space between lines, baseline to baseline.  It is
     stored in the parameter '\baselineskip'.  The default
     '\baselineskip' for the Computer Modern typeface is 1.2 times the
     '\fontsize'.  Changing '\baselineskip' directly is inadvisable
     since its value is reset every time a size change happens; see
     '\baselinestretch', next.

'\baselinestretch'
     LaTeX multiplies the line spacing by the value of the
     '\baselinestretch' parameter; the default factor is 1.  A change
     takes effect when '\selectfont' (see below) is called.  You can
     make line skip changes happen for the entire document by doing
     '\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{2.0}' in the preamble.

     However, the best way to double-space a document is to use the
     'setspace' package.  In addition to offering a number of spacing
     options, this package keeps the line spacing single-spaced in
     places where that is typically desirable, such as footnotes and
     figure captions.  See the package documentation.

'\linespread{FACTOR}'
     Equivalent to '\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{FACTOR}', and
     therefore must be followed by '\selectfont' to have any effect.
     Best specified in the preamble, or use the 'setspace' package, as
     just described.

'\selectfont'
     The effects of the font commands described above do not happen
     until '\selectfont' is called, as in
     '\fontfamily{FAMILYNAME}\selectfont'.  It is often useful to put
     this in a macro:
     '\newcommand*{\myfont}{\fontfamily{FAMILYNAME}\selectfont}'
     (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::).

'\usefont{ENC}{FAMILY}{SERIES}{SHAPE}'
     The same as invoking '\fontencoding', '\fontfamily', '\fontseries'
     and '\fontshape' with the given parameters, followed by
     '\selectfont'.  For example:

          \usefont{ot1}{cmr}{m}{n}

File: latex2e.info,  Node: \onecolumn,  Next: \twocolumn,  Up: Layout

5.1 '\onecolumn'
================

Start a new page and produce single-column output.  If the document is
given the class option 'onecolumn' then this is the default behavior
(*note Document class options::).

   This command is fragile (*note \protect::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \twocolumn,  Next: \flushbottom,  Prev: \onecolumn,  Up: Layout

5.2 '\twocolumn'
================

Synopses:

     \twocolumn
     \twocolumn[PRELIM ONE COLUMN TEXT]

   Start a new page and produce two-column output.  If the document is
given the class option 'twocolumn' then this is the default (*note
Document class options::).

   If the optional PRELIM ONE COLUMN TEXT argument is present, it is
typeset in one-column mode before the two-column typesetting starts.

   This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   These parameters control typesetting in two-column output:

'\columnsep'
     The distance between columns.  The default is 35pt.  Change it with
     a command such as '\setlength{\columnsep}{40pt}' You must change it
     before the two column environment starts; in the preamble is a good
     place.

'\columnseprule'
     The width of the rule between columns.  The rule appears halfway
     between the two columns.  The default is 0pt, meaning that there is
     no rule.  Change it with a command such as
     '\setlength{\columnseprule}{0.4pt}', before the two-column
     environment starts.

'\columnwidth'
     The width of a single column.  In one-column mode this is equal to
     '\textwidth'.  In two-column mode by default LaTeX sets the width
     of each of the two columns to be half of '\textwidth' minus
     '\columnsep'.

   In a two-column document, the starred environments 'table*' and
'figure*' are two columns wide, whereas the unstarred environments
'table' and 'figure' take up only one column (*note figure:: and *note
table::).  LaTeX places starred floats at the top of a page.  The
following parameters control float behavior of two-column output.

'\dbltopfraction'
     The maximum fraction at the top of a two-column page that may be
     occupied by two-column wide floats.  The default is 0.7, meaning
     that the height of a 'table*' or 'figure*' environment must not
     exceed '0.7\textheight' .  If the height of your starred float
     environment exceeeds this then you can take one of the following
     actions to prevent it from floating all the way to the back of the
     document:

        * Use the '[tp]' location specifier to tell LaTeX to try to put
          the bulky float on a page by itself, as well as at the top of
          a page.

        * Use the '[t!]' location specifier to override the effect of
          '\dbltopfraction' for this particular float.

        * Increase the value of '\dbltopfraction' to a suitably large
          number, to avoid going to float pages so soon.

     You can redefine it, for instance with
     '\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}'.

'\dblfloatpagefraction'
     For a float page of two-column wide floats, this is the minimum
     fraction that must be occupied by floats, limiting the amount of
     blank space.  LaTeX's default is '0.5'.  Change it with
     '\renewcommand'.

'\dblfloatsep'
     On a float page of two-column wide floats, this length is the
     distance between floats, at both the top and bottom of the page.
     The default is '12pt plus2pt minus2pt' for a document set at '10pt'
     or '11pt', and '14pt plus2pt minus4pt' for a document set at
     '12pt'.

'\dbltextfloatsep'
     This length is the distance between a multi-column float at the top
     or bottom of a page and the main text.  The default is '20pt
     plus2pt minus4pt'.

'\dbltopnumber'
     On a float page of two-column wide floats, this counter gives the
     maximum number of floats allowed at the top of the page.  The LaTeX
     default is '2'.

   This example uses '\twocolumn''s optional argument of to create a
title that spans the two-column article:

     \documentclass[twocolumn]{article}
     \newcommand{\authormark}[1]{\textsuperscript{#1}}
     \begin{document}
     \twocolumn[{% inside this optional argument goes one-column text
       \centering
       \LARGE The Title \\[1.5em]
       \large Author One\authormark{1},
              Author Two\authormark{2},
              Author Three\authormark{1} \\[1em]
       \normalsize
       \begin{tabular}{p{.2\textwidth}@{\hspace{2em}}p{.2\textwidth}}
         \authormark{1}Department one  &\authormark{2}Department two \\
          School one                   &School two
       \end{tabular}\\[3em] % space below title part
       }]

File: latex2e.info,  Node: \flushbottom,  Next: \raggedbottom,  Prev: \twocolumn,  Up: Layout

5.3 '\flushbottom'
==================

Make all pages in the documents after this declaration have the same
height, by stretching the vertical space where necessary to fill out the
page.  This is most often used when making two-sided documents since the
differences in facing pages can be glaring.

   If TeX cannot satisfactorily stretch the vertical space in a page
then you get a message like 'Underfull \vbox (badness 10000) has
occurred while \output is active'.  If you get that, one option is to
change to '\raggedbottom' (*note \raggedbottom::).  Alternatively, you
can adjust the 'textheight' to make compatible pages, or you can add
some vertical stretch glue between lines or between paragraphs, as in
'\setlength{\parskip}{0ex plus0.1ex}'.  Your last option is to, in a
final editing stage, adjust the height of individual pages (*note
\enlargethispage::).

   The '\flushbottom' state is the default only if you select the
'twoside' document class option (*note Document class options::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \raggedbottom,  Next: Page layout parameters,  Prev: \flushbottom,  Up: Layout

5.4 '\raggedbottom'
===================

Make all later pages the natural height of the material on that page; no
rubber vertical lengths will be stretched.  Thus, in a two-sided
document the facing pages may be different heights.  This command can go
at any point in the document body.  See *note \flushbottom::.

   This is the default unless you select the 'twoside' document class
option (*note Document class options::).

5.5 Page layout parameters
==========================

'\columnsep'
'\columnseprule'
'\columnwidth'
     The distance between the two columns, the width of a rule between
     the columns, and the width of the columns, when the document class
     option 'twocolumn' is in effect (*note Document class options::).
     *Note \twocolumn::.

'\headheight'
     Height of the box that contains the running head.  The default in
     the 'article', 'report', and 'book' classes is '12pt', at all type
     sizes.

'\headsep'
     Vertical distance between the bottom of the header line and the top
     of the main text.  The default in the 'article' and 'report'
     classes is '25pt'.  In the 'book' class the default is: if the
     document is set at 10pt then it is '0.25in', and at 11pt and 12pt
     it is '0.275in'.

'\footskip'
     Distance from the baseline of the last line of text to the baseline
     of the page footer.  The default in the 'article' and 'report'
     classes is '30pt'.  In the 'book' class the default is: when the
     type size is 10pt the default is '0.35in', while at 11pt it is
     '0.38in', and at 12pt it is '30pt'.

'\linewidth'
     Width of the current line, decreased for each nested 'list' (*note
     list::).  That is, the nominal value for '\linewidth' is to equal
     '\textwidth' but for each nested list the '\linewidth' is decreased
     by the sum of that list's '\leftmargin' and '\rightmargin' (*note
     itemize::).

'\marginparpush'
'\marginsep'
'\marginparwidth'
     The minimum vertical space between two marginal notes, the
     horizontal space between the text body and the marginal notes, and
     the horizontal width of the notes.

     Normally marginal notes appear on the outside of the page, but the
     declaration '\reversemarginpar' changes that (and
     '\normalmarginpar' changes it back).

     The defaults for '\marginparpush' in both 'book' and 'article'
     classes are: '7pt' if the document is set at 12pt, and '5pt' if the
     document is set at 11pt or 10pt.

     For '\marginsep', in 'article' class the default is '10pt' except
     if the document is set at 10pt and in two-column mode where the
     default is '11pt'.

     For '\marginsep' in 'book' class the default is '10pt' in
     two-column mode and '7pt' in one-column mode.

     For '\marginparwidth' in both 'book' and 'article' classes, in
     two-column mode the default is 60% of '\paperwidth - \textwidth',
     while in one-column mode it is 50% of that distance.

'\oddsidemargin'
'\evensidemargin'
     The '\oddsidemargin' is the extra distance between the left side of
     the page and the text's left margin, on odd-numbered pages when the
     document class option 'twoside' is chosen and on all pages when
     'oneside' is in effect.  When 'twoside' is in effect, on
     even-numbered pages the extra distance on the left is
     'evensidemargin'.

     LaTeX's default is that '\oddsidemargin' is 40% of the difference
     between '\paperwidth' and '\textwidth', and '\evensidemargin' is
     the remainder.

'\paperheight'
     The height of the paper, as distinct from the height of the print
     area.  It is normally set with a document class option, as in
     '\documentclass[a4paper]{article}' (*note Document class
     options::).

'\paperwidth'
     The width of the paper, as distinct from the width of the print
     area.  It is normally set with a document class option, as in
     '\documentclass[a4paper]{article}' (*note Document class
     options::).

'\textheight'
     The normal vertical height of the page body.  If the document is
     set at a nominal type size of 10pt then for an 'article' or
     'report' the default is '43\baselineskip', while for a 'book' it is
     '41\baselineskip'.  At a type size of 11pt the default is
     '38\baselineskip' for all document classes.  At 12pt it is
     '36\baselineskip' for all classes.

'\textwidth'
     The full horizontal width of the entire page body.  For an
     'article' or 'report' document, the default is '345pt' when the
     chosen type size is 10pt, the default is '360pt' at 11pt, and it is
     '390pt' at 12pt.  For a 'book' document, the default is '4.5in' at
     a type size of 10pt, and '5in' at 11pt or 12pt.

     In multi-column output, '\textwidth' remains the width of the
     entire page body, while '\columnwidth' is the width of one column
     (*note \twocolumn::).

     In lists (*note list::), '\textwidth' remains the width of the
     entire page body (and '\columnwidth' the width of the entire
     column), while '\linewidth' may decrease for nested lists.

     Inside a minipage (*note minipage::) or '\parbox' (*note
     \parbox::), all the width-related parameters are set to the
     specified width, and revert to their normal values at the end of
     the 'minipage' or '\parbox'.

     This entry is included for completeness: '\hsize' is the TeX
     primitive parameter used when text is broken into lines.  It should
     not be used in normal LaTeX documents.

'\topmargin'
     Space between the top of the TeX page (one inch from the top of the
     paper, by default) and the top of the header.  The value is
     computed based on many other parameters: '\paperheight - 2in -
     \headheight - \headsep - \textheight - \footskip', and then divided
     by two.

'\topskip'
     Minimum distance between the top of the page body and the baseline
     of the first line of text.  For the standard classes, the default
     is the same as the font size, e.g., '10pt' at a type size of 10pt.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Floats,  Prev: Page layout parameters,  Up: Layout

5.6 Floats
==========

Some typographic elements, such as figures and tables, cannot be broken
across pages.  They must be typeset outside of the normal flow of text,
for instance floating to the top of a later page.

   LaTeX can have a number of different classes of floating material.
The default is the two classes, 'figure' (*note figure::) and 'table'
(*note table::), but you can create a new class with the package
'float'.

   Within any one float class LaTeX always respects the order, so that
the first figure in a document source must be typeset before the second
figure.  However, LaTeX may mix the classes, so it can happen that while
the first table appears in the source before the first figure, it
appears in the output after it.

   The placement of floats is subject to parameters, given below, that
limit the number of floats that can appear at the top of a page, and the
bottom, etc.  If so many floats are queued up that the limits prevent
them all from fitting on a page then LaTeX places what it can and defers
the rest to the next page.  In this way, floats may be typset far from
their place in the source.  In particular, a float that is big can
migrate to the end of the document.  But then because all floats in a
class must appear in sequential order, every subsequent float in that
class also appears at the end.

   In addition to changing the parameters, for each float you can tweak
where the float placement algorithm tries to place it by using its
PLACEMENT argument.  The possible values are a sequence of the letters
below.  The default for both 'figure' and 'table', in both 'article' and
'book' classes, is 'tbp'.

't'
     (Top)--at the top of a text page.

'b'
     (Bottom)--at the bottom of a text page.  (However, 'b' is not
     allowed for full-width floats ('figure*') with double-column
     output.  To ameliorate this, use the 'stfloats' or 'dblfloatfix'
     package, but see the discussion at caveats in the FAQ:
     <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=2colfloat>.

'h'
     (Here)--at the position in the text where the 'figure' environment
     appears.  However, 'h' is not allowed by itself; 't' is
     automatically added.

     To absolutely force a float to appear "here", you can
     '\usepackage{float}' and use the 'H' specifier which it defines.
     For further discussion, see the FAQ entry at
     <http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=figurehere>.

'p'
     (Page of floats)--on a separate "float page", which is a page
     containing no text, only floats.

'!'
     Used in addition to one of the above; for this float only, LaTeX
     ignores the restrictions on both the number of floats that can
     appear and the relative amounts of float and non-float text on the
     page.  The '!' specifier does _not_ mean "put the float here"; see
     above.

   Note: the order in which letters appear in the PLACEMENT argument
does not change the order in which LaTeX tries to place the float; for
instance, 'btp' has the same effect as 'tbp'.  All that PLACEMENT does
is that if a letter is not present then the algorithm does not try that
location.  Thus, LaTeX's default of 'tbp' is to try every location
except placing the float where it occurs in the source.

   To prevent LaTeX from moving floats to the end of the document or a
chapter you can use a '\clearpage' command to start a new page and
insert all pending floats.  If a pagebreak is undesirable then you can
use the 'afterpage' package and issue '\afterpage{\clearpage}'.  This
will wait until the current page is finished and then flush all
outstanding floats.

   LaTeX can typeset a float before where it appears in the source
(although on the same output page) if there is a 't' specifier in the
PLACEMENT paramater.  If this is not desired, and deleting the 't' is
not acceptable as it keeps the float from being placed at the top of the
next page, then you can prevent it by either using the 'flafter' package
or using the command '\suppressfloats[t]', which causes floats for the
top position on this page to moved to the next page.

   Parameters relating to fractions of pages occupied by float and
non-float text (change them with '\renewcommand{PARAMETER}{DECIMAL
BETWEEN 0 AND 1}'):

'\bottomfraction'
     The maximum fraction of the page allowed to be occupied by floats
     at the bottom; default '.3'.

'\floatpagefraction'
     The minimum fraction of a float page that must be occupied by
     floats; default '.5'.

'\textfraction'
     Minimum fraction of a page that must be text; if floats take up too
     much space to preserve this much text, floats will be moved to a
     different page.  The default is '.2'.

'\topfraction'
     Maximum fraction at the top of a page that may be occupied before
     floats; default '.7'.

   Parameters relating to vertical space around floats (change them with
'\setlength{PARAMETER}{LENGTH EXPRESSION}'):

'\floatsep'
     Space between floats at the top or bottom of a page; default '12pt
     plus2pt minus2pt'.

'\intextsep'
     Space above and below a float in the middle of the main text;
     default '12pt plus2pt minus2pt' for 10 point and 11 point
     documents, and '14pt plus4pt minus4pt' for 12 point documents.

'\textfloatsep'
     Space between the last (first) float at the top (bottom) of a page;
     default '20pt plus2pt minus4pt'.

   Counters relating to the number of floats on a page (change them with
'\setcounter{CTRNAME}{NATURAL NUMBER}'):

'bottomnumber'
     Maximum number of floats that can appear at the bottom of a text
     page; default 1.

'dbltopnumber'
     Maximum number of full-sized floats that can appear at the top of a
     two-column page; default 2.

'topnumber'
     Maximum number of floats that can appear at the top of a text page;
     default 2.

'totalnumber'
     Maximum number of floats that can appear on a text page; default 3.

   The principal TeX FAQ entry relating to floats
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats> contains
suggestions for relaxing LaTeX's default parameters to reduce the
problem of floats being pushed to the end.  A full explaination of the
float placement algorithm is Frank Mittelbach's article "How to infuence
the position of float environments like figure and table in LaTeX?"

6 Sectioning
************

Sectioning commands provide the means to structure your text into units:

'\part'
'\chapter'
     ('report' and 'book' class only)
'\section'
'\subsection'
'\subsubsection'
'\paragraph'
'\subparagraph'

   All sectioning commands take the same general form, e.g.,

     \chapter[TOCTITLE]{TITLE}

   In addition to providing the heading TITLE in the main text, the
section title can appear in two other places:

  1. The table of contents.
  2. The running head at the top of the page.

   You may not want the same text in these places as in the main text.
To handle this, the sectioning commands have an optional argument
TOCTITLE that, when given, specifies the text for these other places.

   Also, all sectioning commands have '*'-forms that print TITLE as
usual, but do not include a number and do not make an entry in the table
of contents.  For instance:

     \section*{Preamble}

   The '\appendix' command changes the way following sectional units are
numbered.  The '\appendix' command itself generates no text and does not
affect the numbering of parts.  The normal use of this command is
something like

     \chapter{A Chapter}
     ...
     \appendix
     \chapter{The First Appendix}

   The 'secnumdepth' counter controls printing of section numbers.  The
setting

     \setcounter{secnumdepth}{LEVEL}

suppresses heading numbers at any depth > LEVEL, where 'chapter' is
level zero.  (*Note \setcounter::.)

7 Cross references
******************

One reason for numbering things such as figures and equations is to
refer the reader to them, as in "See Figure~3 for more details."

   Including the figure number in the source is poor practice since if
that number changes as the document evolves then you must remember to
update this reference by hand.  Instead, LaTeX has you write something
like '\label{eq:GreensThm}' and refer to it with 'See
equation~\ref{eq:GreensThm}'.

   LaTeX writes the information from the labels to a file with the same
name as the file containing the '\label{...}' but with an '.aux'
extension.  (The information has the format
'\newlabel{LABEL}{{CURRENTLABEL}{PAGENUMBER}}' where CURRENTLABEL is the
current value of the macro '\@currentlabel' that is usually updated
whenever you call '\refstepcounter{COUNTER}'.)

   The most common side effect of the prior paragraph happens when your
document has a "forward reference", a '\ref{KEY}' that appears earlier
than the associated '\label{KEY}'; see the example in the
'\pageref{...}' description.  LaTeX gets the information for references
from the '.aux' file.  If this is the first time you are running the
document then you will get a message 'LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have
changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.' and in the output the
reference will appear as two question marks '??', in boldface.  Or, if
you change some things so the references change then you get the same
warning and the output contains the old reference information.  The
solution in either case is just to compile the document a second time.

* Menu:

* \label::      Assign a symbolic name to a piece of text.
* \pageref::    Refer to a page number.
* \ref::        Refer to a section, figure or similar.

7.1 '\label'
============

Synopsis:

     \label{KEY}

   Assign a number to KEY.  In ordinary text '\label{KEY}' assigns to
KEY the number of the current sectional unit.  Inside an environment
with numbering, such as a 'table' or 'theorem' environment,
'\label{KEY}' assigns to KEY the number of that environment.  Retrieve
the assigned number with the '\ref{KEY}' command (*note \ref::).

   A key name can consist of any sequence of letters, digits, or common
punctuation characters.  Upper and lowercase letters are distinguished,
as usual.

   A common convention is to use labels consisting of a prefix and a
suffix separated by a colon or period.  This helps to avoid accidentally
creating two labels with the same name, and makes your source more
readable.  Some commonly-used prefixes:

'ch'
     for chapters
'sec'
     for lower-level sectioning commands
'fig'
     for figures
'tab'
     for tables
'eq'
     for equations

   Thus, '\label{fig:Euler}' is a label for a figure with a portrait of
the great man.

   In this example below the key 'sec:test' will get the number of the
current section and the key 'fig:test' will get the number of the
figure.  (Incidentally, put labels after captions in figures and
tables.)

     \section{section name}
     \label{sec:test}
     This is Section~\ref{sec:test}.
     \begin{figure}
       ...
       \caption{caption text}
       \label{fig:test}
     \end{figure}
     See Figure~\ref{fig:test}.

7.2 '\pageref{KEY}'
===================

Synopsis:

     \pageref{KEY}

   Produce the page number of the place in the text where the
corresponding '\label'{KEY} command appears.

   In this example the '\label{eq:main}' is used both for the formula
number and for the page number.  (Note that the two references are
forward references, so this document would need to be compiled twice to
resolve those.)

     The main result is formula~\ref{eq:main} on page~\pageref{eq:main}.
       ...
     \begin{equation} \label{eq:main}
        \mathbf{P}=\mathbf{NP}

7.3 '\ref{KEY}'
===============

Synopsis:

     \ref{KEY}

   Produces the number of the sectional unit, equation, footnote,
figure, ..., of the corresponding '\label' command (*note \label::).  It
does not produce any text, such as the word 'Section' or 'Figure', just
the bare number itself.

   In this example, the '\ref{popular}' produces '2'.  Note that it is a
forward reference since it comes before '\label{popular}'.

     The most widely-used format is item number~\ref{popular}.
     \begin{enumerate}
     \item Plain \TeX
     \item \label{popular} \LaTeX

8.1 'abstract'
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{abstract}
     ...
     \end{abstract}

   Environment for producing an abstract, possibly of multiple
paragraphs.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: array,  Next: center,  Prev: abstract,  Up: Environments

8.2 'array'
===========

Synopsis:

     \begin{array}{COLS}
     COLUMN 1 ENTRY &COLUMN 2 ENTRY ... &COLUMN N ENTRY \\
     ...
     \end{array}

   or

     \begin{array}[POS]{COLS}
     COLUMN 1 ENTRY &COLUMN 2 ENTRY ... &COLUMN N ENTRY \\
     ...
     \end{array}

   Produce a mathematical array.  This environment can only be used in
math mode, and normally appears within a displayed mathematics
environment such as 'equation' (*note equation::).  Column entries are
separated by an ampersand ('&').  Rows are terminated with
double-backslashes ('\\') (*note \\::).

   The required argument COLS describes the number of columns, their
alignment, and the formatting of the intercolumn regions.  See *note
tabular:: for the complete description of COLS, and of the other common
features of the two environments, including the optional POS argument.

   There are two ways that 'array' diverges from 'tabular'.  The first
is that 'array' entries are typeset in mathematics mode, in textstyle
(except if the COLS definition specifies the column with '@p{...}',
which causes the entry to be typeset in text mode).  The second is that,
instead of 'tabular''s parameter '\tabcolsep', LaTeX's intercolumn space
in an array is governed by '\arraycolsep' which gives half the width
between columns.  The default for this is '5pt'.

   To obtain arrays with braces the standard is to use the 'amsmath'
package.  It comes with environments 'pmatrix' for an array surrounded
by parentheses '(..)', 'bmatrix' for an array surrounded by square
brackets '[..]', 'Bmatrix' for an array surrounded by curly
braces '{...}', 'vmatrix' for an array surrounded by vertical
bars '|...|', and 'Vmatrix' for an array surrounded by double vertical
bars '||...||', along with a number of other array constructs.

   Here is an example of an array:

     \begin{equation}
       \begin{array}{cr}
         \sqrt{y}  &12.3 \\
         x^2       &3.4
       \end{array}

8.3 'center'
============

Synopsis:

     \begin{center}
      .. text ..
     \end{center}

   Environment to create a sequence of lines that are centered within
the left and right margins on the current page.  If the text in the
environment body is too long to fit on a line, LaTeX will insert line
breaks that avoid hyphenation and avoid stretching or shrinking any
interword space.  To force a line break at a particular spot use
double-backslash '\\' (*note \\::).

   This environment inserts space above and below the text body.  See
*note \centering:: to avoid such space, for example inside a 'figure'
environment.

   In this example, depending on the line width, LaTeX may choose a
break for the part before the double backslash, will center the line or
two, then will break at the double backslash, and will center the
ending.

     \begin{center}
       My father considered that anyone who went to chapel and didn't drink
       alcohol was not to be tolerated.\\
       I grew up in that belief.  --Richard Burton
     \end{center}

   A double backslash after the final line is optional.

* Menu:

* \centering::          Declaration form of the 'center' environment.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \centering,  Up: center

8.3.1 '\centering'
------------------

Declaration that causes material in its scope to be centered.  It is
most often used inside an environment such as 'figure', or in a
'parbox'.

   Unlike the 'center' environment, the '\centering' command does not
add vertical space above and below the text.

   It also does not start a new paragraph; it simply changes how LaTeX
formats paragraph units.  If 'ww {\centering xx \\ yy} zz' is surrounded
by blank lines then LaTeX will create a paragraph whose first line 'ww
xx' is centered and whose second line, not centered, contains 'yy zz'.
Usually what is desired is for the scope of the declaration to contain a
blank line or the '\end' command of an environment such as 'figure' or
'table' that ends the paragraph unit.  Thus, if '{\centering xx \\
yy\par} zz' is surrounded by blank lines then it makes a new paragraph
with two centered lines 'xx' and 'yy', followed by a new paragraph with
'zz' that is formatted as usual.  See also the following example.

   This example's '\centering' causes the graphic to be horizontally
centered.

     \begin{figure}
       \centering
       \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ctan_lion.png}
       \caption{CTAN Lion}  \label{fig:CTANLion}
     \end{figure}

   The scope of the '\centering' ends with the '\end{figure}'.

8.4 'description'
=================

Synopsis:

     \begin{description}
     \item [FIRST LABEL] text of first item
     \item [SECOND LABEL] text of second item
       ...
     \end{description}

   Environment to make a labelled list of items.  Each item's LABEL is
typeset in bold, flush-left.  Each item's text may contain multiple
paragraphs.  Although the labels on the items are optional there is no
sensible default, so all items should have labels.

   The list consists of at least one item; see *note \item:: (having no
items causes the LaTeX error 'Something's wrong--perhaps a missing
\item').  Each item is produced with an '\item' command.

   Since the labels are in bold style, if the label text calls for a
font change given in argument style (see *note Font styles::) then it
will come out bold.  For instance, if the label text calls for
typewriter with '\item[\texttt{label text}]' then it will appear in bold
typewriter, if that is available.  The simplest way to get non-bolded
typewriter is to use declaritive style '\item[{\tt label text}]'.
Similarly, get normal text use '\item[{\rm label text}]'.

   For other major LaTeX labelled list environments, see *note itemize::
and *note enumerate::.  For information about customizing list layout,
see *note list::; also, the package 'enumitem' is useful for this.

   This example shows the environment used for a sequence of
definitions.

     \begin{definition}
       \item[lama] A priest.
       \item[llama] A beast.
     \end{definition}

8.5 'displaymath'
=================

Synopsis:

     \begin{displaymath}
       .. math text ..
     \end{displaymath}

   Environment to typeset the math text on its own line, in display
style and centered.  To make the text be flush-left use the global
option 'fleqn'; see *note Document class options::.

   LaTeX will not break the math text across lines.

   In the 'displaymath' environment no equation number is added to the
math text.  One way to get an equation number is to use the 'equation'
environment (*note equation::).

   Note that the 'amsmath' package has extensive displayed equation
facilities.  Those facilities are the best approach for such output in
new documents.  For example, there are a number of options in that
package for having math text broken across lines.

   The construct '\[..math text..\]' is essentially a synonym for
'\begin{displaymath}..math text..\end{displaymath}' but the latter is
easier to work with in the source file; for instance, searching for a
square bracket may get false positives but the word 'displaymath' will
likely be unique.  (The construct '$$..math text..$$' from Plain TeX is
sometimes mistakenly used as a synonym for 'displaymath'.  It is not a
synonym, because the 'displaymath' environment checks that it isn't
started in math mode and that it ends in math mode begun by the matching
environment start, because the 'displaymath' environment has different
vertical spacing, and because the 'displaymath' environment honors the
'fleqn' option.)

   The output from this example is centered and alone on its line.
     \begin{displaymath}
       \int_1^2 x^2\,dx=7/3
     \end{displaymath}
   Also, the integral sign is larger than the inline version '\(
\int_1^2 x^2\,dx=7/3 \)' produces.

* \AtEndDocument::            Hook for commands at the end of the document.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \AtBeginDocument,  Next: \AtEndDocument,  Up: document

Synopsis:

     \AtBeginDocument{CODE}

   Save CODE and execute it when '\begin{document}' is executed, at the
very end of the preamble.  The code is executed after the font selection
tables have been set up, so the normal font for the document is the
current font.  However, the code is executed as part of the preamble so
you cannot do any typesetting with it.

   You can issue this command more than once; the successive code lines
will be executed in the order that you gave them.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \AtEndDocument,  Prev: \AtBeginDocument,  Up: document

Synopsis:

     \AtEndDocument{CODE}

   Save CODE and execute it near the end of the document.  Specifically,
it is executed when '\end{document}' is executed, before the final page
is finished and before any leftover floating environments are processed.
If you want some of the code to be executed after these two processes
then include a '\clearpage' at the appropriate point in CODE.

   You can issue this command more than once; the successive code lines

8.7 'enumerate'

Synopsis:

     \begin{enumerate}
     \item [FIRST LABEL] text of first item
     \item [SECOND LABEL] text of second item
     ...
     \end{enumerate}

   Environment to produce a numbered list of items.  The format of the
label numbering depends on whether this environment is nested within
another; see below.

   The list consists of at least one item.  Having no items causes the
LaTeX error 'Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item'.  Each item is
produced with an '\item' command.

   This example lists the top two finishers in the 1908 Olympic
marathon.

     \begin{enumerate}
      \item Johnny Hayes (USA)
      \item Charles Hefferon (RSA)
     \end{enumerate}

   Enumerations may be nested within a paragraph-making environment,
including 'itemize' (*note itemize::), 'description' (*note
description::) and 'enumeration', up to four levels deep.  The format of
the label produced depends on the place in the nesting.  This gives
LaTeX's default for the format at each nesting level (where 1 is the
outermost level):

  1. arabic number followed by a period: '1.', '2.', ...
  2. lower case letter inside parentheses: '(a)', '(b)' ...
  3. lower case roman numeral followed by a period: 'i.', 'ii.', ...
  4. upper case letter followed by a period: 'A.', 'B.', ...

   The 'enumerate' environment uses the counters '\enumi' through
'\enumiv' counters (*note Counters::).  If you use the optional argument
to '\item' then the counter is not incremented for that item (*note
\item::).

   To change the format of the label use '\renewcommand' (*note
\newcommand & \renewcommand::) on the commands '\labelenumi' through
'\labelenumiv'.  For instance, this first level list will be labelled
with uppercase letters, in boldface, and without a trailing period:

     \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{\Alph{enumi}}}
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item eI
       \item bi:
       \item si:
     \end{enumerate}

   For a list of counter-labelling commands like '\Alph' see *note \alph
\Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol::.

   For more on customizing the layout see *note list::.  Also, the
package 'enumitem' is useful for this.

8.8 'eqnarray'
==============

First, a caveat: the 'eqnarray' environment is depreciated.  It has
infelicities that cannot be overcome, including spacing that is
inconsistent with other mathematics elements (see the article "Avoid
eqnarray!" by Lars Madsen
<http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb33-1/tb103madsen.pdf>).  New documents should
include the 'amsmath' package and use the displayed mathematics
environments provided there, such as the 'align' environment.

   Nevertheless, for completeness and for a reference when working with
old documents, a synopsis:

     \begin{eqnarray}
       FIRST FORMULA LEFT  &FIRST FORMULA MIDDLE  &FIRST FORMULA RIGHT \\
       ...
     \end{eqnarray}

   or

     \begin{eqnarray*}
       FIRST FORMULA LEFT  &FIRST FORMULA MIDDLE  &FIRST FORMULA RIGHT \\
       ...
     \end{eqnarray*}

   Display a sequence of equations or inequalities.  The left and right
sides are typeset in display mode, while the middle is typeset in text
mode.

   It is similar to a three-column 'array' environment, with items
within a row separated by an ampersand ('&'), and with rows separated by
double backslash  '\\').  The starred form of line break ('\\*') can
also be used to separate equations, and will disallow a page break there
(*note \\::).

   The unstarred form 'eqnarray' places an equation number on every line
(using the 'equation' counter), unless that line contains a '\nonumber'
command.  The starred form 'eqnarray*' omits equation numbering, while
otherwise being the same.

   The command '\lefteqn' is used for splitting long formulas across
lines.  It typesets its argument in display style flush left in a box of
zero width.

   This example shows three lines.  The first two lines make an
inequality, while the third line has not entry on the left side.

     \begin{eqnarray*}
       \lefteqn{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}     \\
         &\leq &y_1+y_2+\cdots+y_n      \\
         &=    &z+y_3+\cdots+y_n

   The equation number is generated using the 'equation' counter.

   Note that the 'amsmath' package has extensive displayed equation
facilities.  Those facilities are the best approach for such output in
new documents.

8.10 'figure'
=============

Synopsis:

     \begin{figure}[PLACEMENT]
       figure body
     \caption[LOFTITLE]{TITLE}
     \label{LABEL}
     \end{figure}

   or

     \begin{figure*}[PLACEMENT]
       figure body
     \caption[LOFTITLE]{TITLE}
     \label{LABEL}
     \end{figure*}

   A class of floats (*note Floats::).  Because they cannot be split
across pages, they are not typeset in sequence with the normal text but
instead are "floated" to a convenient place, such as the top of a
following page.

   For the possible values of PLACEMENT and their effect on the float
placement algorithm, see *note Floats::.

   The starred form 'figure*' is used when a document is in
double-column mode (*note \twocolumn::).  It produces a figure that
spans both columns, at the top of the page.  To add the possibility of
placing at a page bottom see the discussion of PLACEMENT 'b' in *note
Floats::.

   The figure body is typeset in a 'parbox' of width '\textwidth' and so
it can contain text, commands, etc.

   The label is optional; it is used for cross-references (*note Cross
references::).  The optional '\caption' command specifies caption text
for the figure.  By default it is numbered.  If LOFTITLE is present, it
is used in the list of figures instead of TITLE (*note Tables of
contents::).

   This example makes a figure out of a graphic.  It requires one of the
packages 'graphics' or 'graphicx'.  The graphic, with its caption, will
be placed at the top of a page or, if it is pushed to the end of the
document, on a page of floats.

8.11 'filecontents': Write an external file
===========================================

Synopsis:

     \begin{filecontents}{FILENAME}
       TEXT
     \end{filecontents}

   or

     \begin{filecontents*}{FILENAME}
       TEXT
     \end{filecontents*}

   Create a file named FILENAME and fill it with TEXT.  The unstarred
version of the environment 'filecontents' prefixes the content of the
created file with a header; see the example below.  The starred version
'filecontents*' does not include the header.

   This environment can be used anywhere in the preamble, although it
often appears before the '\documentclass' command.  It is typically used
when a source file requires a nonstandard style or class file.  The
environment will write that file to the directory containing the source
and thus make the source file self-contained.  Another use is to include
'bib' references in the file, again to make it self-contained.

   The environment checks whether a file of that name already exists and
if so, does not do anything.  There is a 'filecontents' package that
redefines the 'filecontents' environment so that instead of doing
nothing in that case, it will overwrite the existing file.

   For example, this document

     \documentclass{article}
     \begin{filecontents}{JH.sty}
     \newcommand{\myname}{Jim Hef{}feron}
     \end{filecontents}
     \usepackage{JH}
     \begin{document}
     Article by \myname.
     \end{document}

   produces this file 'JH.sty'.

     %% LaTeX2e file `JH.sty'
     %% generated by the `filecontents' environment
     %% from source `test' on 2015/10/12.

8.14 'itemize'
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{itemize}
     \item ITEM1
     \item ITEM2
     ...
     \end{itemize}

   The 'itemize' environment produces an "unordered", "bulleted" list.
Itemizations can be nested within one another, up to four levels deep.
They can also be nested within other paragraph-making environments, such
as 'enumerate' (*note enumerate::).

   Each item of an 'itemize' list begins with an '\item' command.  There
must be at least one '\item' command within the environment.

   By default, the marks at each level look like this:

  1. * (bullet)
  2. -- (bold en-dash)
  3. * (asterisk)
  4. .  (centered dot, rendered here as a period)

   The 'itemize' environment uses the commands '\labelitemi' through
'\labelitemiv' to produce the default label.  So, you can use
'\renewcommand' to change the labels.  For instance, to have the first
level use diamonds:

     \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\diamond$}

   The '\leftmargini' through '\leftmarginvi' parameters define the
distance between the left margin of the enclosing environment and the
left margin of the list.  By convention, '\leftmargin' is set to the
appropriate '\leftmarginN' when a new level of nesting is entered.

   The defaults vary from '.5em' (highest levels of nesting) to '2.5em'
(first level), and are a bit reduced in two-column mode.  This example
greatly reduces the margin space for outermost lists:

     \setlength{\leftmargini}{1.25em} % default 2.5em

   Some parameters that affect list formatting:

'\itemindent'
     Extra indentation before each item in a list; default zero.

'\labelsep'
     Space between the label and text of an item; default '.5em'.

'\labelwidth'
     Width of the label; default '2em', or '1.5em' in two-column mode.

'\listparindent'
     Extra indentation added to second and subsequent paragraphs within
     a list item; default '0pt'.

'\rightmargin'
     Horizontal distance between the right margin of the list and the
     enclosing environment; default '0pt', except in the 'quote',
     'quotation', and 'verse' environments, where it is set equal to
     '\leftmargin'.

   Parameters affecting vertical spacing between list items (rather
loose, by default).

'\itemsep'
     Vertical space between items.  The default is '2pt plus1pt
     minus1pt' for '10pt' documents, '3pt plus2pt minus1pt' for '11pt',
     and '4.5pt plus2pt minus1pt' for '12pt'.

'\parsep'
     Extra vertical space between paragraphs within a list item.
     Defaults are the same as '\itemsep'.

'\topsep'
     Vertical space between the first item and the preceding paragraph.
     For top-level lists, the default is '8pt plus2pt minus4pt' for
     '10pt' documents, '9pt plus3pt minus5pt' for '11pt', and '10pt
     plus4pt minus6pt' for '12pt'.  These are reduced for nested lists.

'\partopsep'
     Extra space added to '\topsep' when the list environment starts a
     paragraph.  The default is '2pt plus1pt minus1pt' for '10pt'
     documents, '3pt plus1pt minus1pt' for '11pt', and '3pt plus2pt
     minus2pt' for '12pt'.

   Especially for lists with short items, it may be desirable to elide
space between items.  Here is an example defining an 'itemize*'
environment with no extra spacing between items, or between paragraphs
within a single item ('\parskip' is not list-specific, *note
\parskip::):

     \newenvironment{itemize*}%
       {\begin{itemize}%
         \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}%
         \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}}%
         \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}}%

This environment is used for creating letters.  *Note Letters::.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: list,  Next: math,  Prev: letter,  Up: Environments

8.16 'list'
===========

The 'list' environment is a generic environment which is used for
defining many of the more specific environments.  It is seldom used in
documents, but often in macros.

     \begin{list}{LABELING}{SPACING}
     \item ITEM1
     \item ITEM2
     ...
     \end{list}

   The mandatory LABELING argument specifies how items should be
labelled (unless the optional argument is supplied to '\item').  This
argument is a piece of text that is inserted in a box to form the label.
It can and usually does contain other LaTeX commands.

   The mandatory SPACING argument contains commands to change the
spacing parameters for the list.  This argument will most often be
empty, i.e., '{}', which leaves the default spacing.

   The width used for typesetting the list items is specified by
'\linewidth' (*note Page layout parameters::).

* Menu:

* \item::          An entry in a list.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \item,  Up: list

Synopsis:

     \item text of item

   or
     \item[OPTIONAL LABEL] text of item

   An entry in a list.  The entries are prefixed by a label, whose
default depends on the list type.

   Because the optional argument OPTIONAL LABEL is surrounded by square
brackets ('[' and ']'), to use square brackets inside the optional
argument you must hide them inside curly braces, as in '\item[Close
square bracket, {]}]'.  Similarly, to use an open square bracket as
first character in the text of the item, also hide it inside curly
braces.  *Note LaTeX command syntax::.

   In this example the 'enumerate' list has two items that use the
default label and one that uses the optional label.

     \begin{enumerate}
       \item Moe
       \item[sometimes] Shemp
       \item Larry
     \end{enumerate}

   The first item is labelled '1.', the second item is labelled
'sometimes', and the third item is labelled '2.' (note that, because of
the optional label in the second item, the third item does not get a
'3.').

8.17 'math'
===========

Synopsis:

     \begin{math}
     MATH
     \end{math}

   The 'math' environment inserts the given MATH within the running
text.  '\(...\)' and '$...$' are synonyms.  *Note Math formulas::.

8.18 'minipage'
===============

     \begin{minipage}[POSITION][HEIGHT][INNER-POS]{WIDTH}
     TEXT
     \end{minipage}

   The 'minipage' environment typesets its body TEXT in a block that
will not be broken across pages.  This is similar to the '\parbox'
command (*note \parbox::), but unlike '\parbox', other paragraph-making
environments can be used inside a minipage.

   The arguments are the same as for '\parbox' (*note \parbox::).

   By default, paragraphs are not indented in the 'minipage'
environment.  You can restore indentation with a command such as
'\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}' command.

   Footnotes in a 'minipage' environment are handled in a way that is
particularly useful for putting footnotes in figures or tables.  A
'\footnote' or '\footnotetext' command puts the footnote at the bottom
of the minipage instead of at the bottom of the page, and it uses the
'\mpfootnote' counter instead of the ordinary 'footnote' counter (*note
Counters::).

   However, don't put one minipage inside another if you are using
footnotes; they may wind up at the bottom of the wrong minipage.

8.19 'picture'
==============

     \begin{picture}(WIDTH,HEIGHT)(XOFFSET,YOFFSET)
     ... PICTURE COMMANDS ...
     \end{picture}

   The 'picture' environment allows you to create just about any kind of
picture you want containing text, lines, arrows and circles.  You tell
LaTeX where to put things in the picture by specifying their
coordinates.  A coordinate is a number that may have a decimal point and
a minus sign--a number like '5', '0.3' or '-3.1416'.  A coordinate
specifies a length in multiples of the unit length '\unitlength', so if
'\unitlength' has been set to '1cm', then the coordinate 2.54 specifies
a length of 2.54 centimeters.

   You should only change the value of '\unitlength', using the
'\setlength' command, outside of a 'picture' environment.  The default
value is '1pt'.

   A "position" is a pair of coordinates, such as '(2.4,-5)', specifying
the point with x-coordinate '2.4' and y-coordinate '-5'.  Coordinates
are specified in the usual way with respect to an origin, which is
normally at the lower-left corner of the picture.  Note that when a
position appears as an argument, it is not enclosed in braces; the
parentheses serve to delimit the argument.

   The 'picture' environment has one mandatory argument which is a
position (WIDTH,HEIGHT), which specifies the size of the picture.  The
environment produces a rectangular box with these WIDTH and HEIGHT.

   The 'picture' environment also has an optional position argument
(XOFFSET,YOFFSET), following the size argument, that can change the
origin.  (Unlike ordinary optional arguments, this argument is not
contained in square brackets.)  The optional argument gives the
coordinates of the point at the lower-left corner of the picture
(thereby determining the origin).  For example, if '\unitlength' has
been set to '1mm', the command

     \begin{picture}(100,200)(10,20)

produces a picture of width 100 millimeters and height 200 millimeters,
whose lower-left corner is the point (10,20) and whose upper-right
corner is therefore the point (110,220).  When you first draw a picture,
you typically omit the optional argument, leaving the origin at the
lower-left corner.  If you then want to modify your picture by shifting
everything, you can just add the appropriate optional argument.

   The environment's mandatory argument determines the nominal size of
the picture.  This need bear no relation to how large the picture really
is; LaTeX will happily allow you to put things outside the picture, or
even off the page.  The picture's nominal size is used by LaTeX in
determining how much room to leave for it.

   Everything that appears in a picture is drawn by the '\put' command.
The command

     \put (11.3,-.3){...}

puts the object specified by '...' in the picture, with its reference
point at coordinates (11.3,-.3).  The reference points for various
objects will be described below.

   The '\put' command creates an "LR box".  You can put anything that
can go in an '\mbox' (*note \mbox::) in the text argument of the '\put'
command.  When you do this, the reference point will be the lower left
corner of the box.

   The 'picture' commands are described in the following sections.

* Menu:

* \circle::             Draw a circle.
* \makebox (picture)::  Draw a box of the specified size.
* \framebox (picture):: Draw a box with a frame around it.

   The optional argument, '[POSITION]', specifies the quadrant that your
TEXT appears in.  You may select up to two of the following:

't'
     Moves the item to the top of the rectangle.

'b'
     Moves the item to the bottom.

---------------

Synopsis:

     \oval(WIDTH,HEIGHT)[PORTION]

   The '\oval' command produces a rectangle with rounded corners.  The
optional argument PORTION allows you to produce only half of the oval
via the following:

't'
     selects the top half;
'b'
     selects the bottom half;
'r'
     selects the right half;
'l'
     selects the left half.

   It is also possible to produce only one quarter of the oval by
setting PORTION to 'tr', 'br', 'bl', or 'tl'.

   The "corners" of the oval are made with quarter circles with a
maximum radius of 20pt, so large "ovals" will look more like boxes with
rounded corners.

8.20 'quotation' and 'quote'

     \begin{quotation}
     TEXT
     \end{quotation}

   or

     \begin{quote}
     TEXT
     \end{quote}

   Include a quotation.

   In both environments, margins are indented on both sides by
'\leftmargin' and the text is justified at both.  As with the main text,
leaving a blank line produces a new paragraph.

   To compare the two: in the 'quotation' environment, paragraphs are
indented by 1.5em and the space between paragraphs is small, '0pt plus
1pt'.  In the 'quote' environment, paragraphs are not indented and there
is vertical space between paragraphs (it is the rubber length
'\parsep').  Thus, the 'quotation' environment may be more suitable for
documents where new paragraphs are marked by an indent rather than by a
vertical separation.  In addition, 'quote' may be more suitable for a
short quotation or a sequence of short quotations.

     \begin{quotation}
     \it Four score and seven years ago
       .. shall not perish from the earth.

   The 'tabbing' environment provides a way to align text in columns.
It works by setting tab stops and tabbing to them much as was done on an
ordinary typewriter.  It is best suited for cases where the width of
each column is constant and known in advance.

   This environment can be broken across pages, unlike the 'tabular'
environment.

   The following commands can be used inside a 'tabbing' environment:

'\\ (tabbing)'
     End a line.

'\= (tabbing)'
     Sets a tab stop at the current position.

'\> (tabbing)'
     Advances to the next tab stop.

'\<'
     Put following text to the left of the local margin (without
     changing the margin).  Can only be used at the start of the line.

'\+'
     Moves the left margin of the next and all the following commands
     one tab stop to the right, beginning tabbed line if necessary.

'\-'
     Moves the left margin of the next and all the following commands
     one tab stop to the left, beginning tabbed line if necessary.

'\' (tabbing)'
     Moves everything that you have typed so far in the current column,
     i.e., everything from the most recent '\>', '\<', '\'', '\\', or
     '\kill' command, to the right of the previous column, flush against
     the current column's tab stop.

'\` (tabbing)'
     Allows you to put text flush right against any tab stop, including
     tab stop 0.  However, it can't move text to the right of the last
     column because there's no tab stop there.  The '\`' command moves
     all the text that follows it, up to the '\\' or '\end{tabbing}'
     command that ends the line, to the right margin of the tabbing
     environment.  There must be no '\>' or '\'' command between the
     '\`' and the command that ends the line.

'\a (tabbing)'
     In a 'tabbing' environment, the commands '\=', '\'' and '\`' do not
     produce accents as usual (*note Accents::).  Instead, the commands
     '\a=', '\a'' and '\a`' are used.

'\kill'
     Sets tab stops without producing text.  Works just like '\\' except
     that it throws away the current line instead of producing output
     for it.  The effect of any '\=', '\+' or '\-' commands in that line
     remain in effect.

'\poptabs'
     Restores the tab stop positions saved by the last '\pushtabs'.

'\pushtabs'
     Saves all current tab stop positions.  Useful for temporarily
     changing tab stop positions in the middle of a 'tabbing'
     environment.

'\tabbingsep'
     Distance to left of tab stop moved by '\''.

   This example typesets a Pascal function in a traditional format:

     \begin{tabbing}
     function \= fact(n : integer) : integer;\\
              \> begin \= \+ \\
                    \> if \= n $>$ 1 then \+ \\
                             fact := n * fact(n-1) \- \\
                       else \+ \\
                             fact := 1; \-\- \\
                 end;\\
     \end{tabbing}

8.22 'table'
============

Synopsis:

     \begin{table}[PLACEMENT]
       table body
     \caption[LOFTITLE]{TITLE}
     \label{LABEL}
     \end{table}

   A class of floats (*note Floats::).  Because they cannot be split
across pages, they are not typeset in sequence with the normal text but
instead are "floated" to a convenient place, such as the top of a
following page.

   For the possible values of PLACEMENT and their effect on the float
placement algorithm, see *note Floats::.

   The table body is typeset in a 'parbox' of width '\textwidth' and so
it can contain text, commands, etc.

   The label is optional; it is used for cross-references (*note Cross
references::).  The optional '\caption' command specifies caption text
for the table.  By default it is numbered.  If LOTTITLE is present, it
is used in the list of tables instead of TITLE (*note Tables of
contents::).

   In this example the table and caption will float to the bottom of a
page, unless it is pushed to a float page at the end.

     \begin{table}[b]
       \centering
       \begin{tabular}{r|p{2in}} \hline
         One &The loneliest number \\
         Two &Can be as sad as one.
              It's the loneliest number since the number one.
       \end{tabular}

8.23 'tabular'
==============

Synopsis:

     \begin{tabular}[POS]{COLS}
     column 1 entry &column 2 entry ... &column n entry \\
       ...
     \end{tabular}

or

     \begin{tabular*}{WIDTH}[POS]{COLS}
     column 1 entry &column 2 entry ... &column n entry \\
       ...
     \end{tabular*}

   These environments produce a table, a box consisting of a sequence of
horizontal rows.  Each row consists of items that are aligned vertically
in columns.  This illustrates many of the features.

     \begin{tabular}{l|l}
       \textit{Player name}  &\textit{Career home runs}  \\
       \hline
       Hank Aaron  &755 \\
       Babe Ruth   &714
     \end{tabular}

   The vertical format of two left-aligned columns, with a vertical bar
between them, is specified in 'tabular''s argument '{l|l}'.  Columns are
separated with an ampersand '&'.  A horizontal rule between two rows is
created with '\hline'.  The end of each row is marked with a double
backslash '\\'.  This '\\' is optional after the last row unless an
'\hline' command follows, to put a rule below the table.

   The required and optional arguments to 'tabular' consist of:

WIDTH
     Required for 'tabular*', not allowed for 'tabular'.  Specifies the
     width of the 'tabular*' environment.  The space between columns
     should be rubber, as with '@{\extracolsep{\fill}}', to allow the
     table to stretch or shrink to make the specified width, or else you
     are likely to get the 'Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) in alignment
     ..' warning.

POS
     Optional.  Specifies the table's vertical position.  The default is
     to align the table so its vertical center matches the baseline of
     the surrounding text.  There are two other possible alignments: 't'
     aligns the table so its top row matches the baseline of the
     surrounding text, and 'b' aligns on the bottom row.

     This only has an effect if there is other text.  In the common case
     of a 'tabular' alone in a 'center' environment this option makes no
     difference.

COLS
     Required.  Specifies the formatting of columns.  It consists of a
     sequence of the following specifiers, corresponding to the types of
     column and intercolumn material.

     'l'
          A column of left-aligned items.

     'r'
          A column of right-aligned items.

     'c'
          A column of centered items.

     '|'
          A vertical line the full height and depth of the environment.

     '@{TEXT OR SPACE}'
          This inserts TEXT OR SPACE at this location in every row.  The
          TEXT OR SPACE material is typeset in LR mode.  This text is
          fragile (*note \protect::).

          This specifier is optional: unless you put in your own
          @-expression then LaTeX's book, article, and report classes
          will put on either side of each column a space of length
          '\tabcolsep', which by default is '6pt'.  That is, by default
          adjacent columns are separated by 12pt (so '\tabcolsep' is
          misleadingly-named since it is not the separation between
          tabular columns).  Also by default a space of 6pt comes before
          the first column as well as after the final column, unless you
          put a '@{...}' or '|' there.

          If you override the default and use an @-expression then you
          must insert any desired space yourself, as in
          '@{\hspace{1em}}'.

          An empty expression '@{}' will eliminate the space, including
          the space at the start or end, as in the example below where
          the tabular lines need to lie on the left margin.

               \begin{flushleft}
                 \begin{tabular}{@{}l}
                   ..
                 \end{tabular}
               \end{flushleft}

          This example shows text, a decimal point, between the columns,
          arranged so the numbers in the table are aligned on that
          decimal point.

               \begin{tabular}{r@{$.$}l}
                 $3$ &$14$  \\
                 $9$ &$80665$
               \end{tabular}

          An '\extracolsep{WD}' command in an @-expression causes an
          extra space of width WD to appear to the left of all
          subsequent columns, until countermanded by another
          '\extracolsep' command.  Unlike ordinary intercolumn space,
          this extra space is not suppressed by an @-expression.  An
          '\extracolsep' command can be used only in an @-expression in
          the 'cols' argument.  Below, LaTeX inserts the right amount of
          intercolumn space to make the entire table 4 inches wide.

               \begin{center}
                 \begin{tabular*}{4in}{l@{\ \ldots\extracolsep{\fill}}l}
                   Seven times down, eight times up
                   &such is life!
                 \end{tabular*}
               \end{center}

          To insert commands that are automatically executed before a
          given column, load the 'array' package and use the '>{...}'
          specifier.

     'p{WD}'
          Each item in the column is typeset in a parbox of width WD.

          Note that a line break double backslash '\\' may not appear in
          the item, except inside an environment like 'minipage',
          'array', or 'tabular', or inside an explicit '\parbox', or in
          the scope of a '\centering', '\raggedright', or '\raggedleft'
          declaration (when used in a 'p'-column element these
          declarations must appear inside braces, as with '{\centering
          .. \\ ..}').  Otherwise LaTeX will misinterpret the double
          backslash as ending the row.

     '*{NUM}{COLS}'
          Equivalent to NUM copies of COLS, where NUM is a positive
          integer and COLS is a list of specifiers.  Thus
          '\begin{tabular}{|*{3}{l|r}|}' is equivalent to
          '\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|rl|r|}'.  Note that COLS may contain
          another '*'-expression.

   Parameters that control formatting:

'\arrayrulewidth'
     A length that is the thickness of the rule created by '|',
     '\hline', and '\vline' in the 'tabular' and 'array' environments.
     The default is '.4pt'.  Change it as in
     '\setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{0.8pt}'.

'\arraystretch'
     A factor by which the spacing between rows in the 'tabular' and
     'array' environments is multiplied.  The default is '1', for no
     scaling.  Change it as '\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}'.

'\doublerulesep'
     A length that is the distance between the vertical rules produced
     by the '||' specifier.  The default is '2pt'.

'\tabcolsep'
     A length that is half of the space between columns.  The default is
     '6pt'.  Change it with '\setlength'.

   The following commands can be used inside the body of a 'tabular'
environment, the first two inside an entry and the second two between
lines:

* Menu:

* \multicolumn::        Make an item spanning several columns.
* \vline::              Draw a vertical line.
* \cline::              Draw a horizontal line spanning some columns.
* \hline::              Draw a horizontal line spanning all columns.

8.23.1 '\multicolumn'
---------------------

Synopsis:

     \multicolumn{NUMCOLS}{COLS}{TEXT}

   Make an 'array' or 'tabular' entry that spans several columns.  The
first argument NUMCOLS gives the number of columns to span.  The second
argument COLS specifies the formatting of the entry, with 'c' for
centered, 'l' for flush left, or 'r' for flush right.  The third
argument TEXT gives the contents of that entry.

   In this example, in the first row, the second and third columns are
spanned by the single heading 'Name'.

     \begin{tabular}{lccl}
       \textit{ID}       &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Name}} &\textit{Age} \\ \hline % row one
       978-0-393-03701-2 &O'Brian &Patrick                  &55           \\        % row two
         ..
     \end{tabular}

   What counts as a column is: the column format specifier for the
'array' or 'tabular' environment is broken into parts, where each part
(except the first) begins with 'l', 'c', 'r', or 'p'.  So from
'\begin{tabular}{|r|ccp{1.5in}|}' the parts are '|r|', 'c', 'c',
and 'p{1.5in}|'.

   The COLS argument overrides the 'array' or 'tabular' environment's
intercolumn area default adjoining this multicolumn entry.  To affect
that area, this argument can contain vertical bars '|' indicating the
placement of vertical rules, and '@{...}' expressions.  Thus if COLS is
'|c|' then this multicolumn entry will be centered and a vertical rule
will come in the intercolumn area before it and after it.  This table
details the exact behavior.

     \begin{tabular}{|cc|c|c|}
       \multicolumn{1}{r}{w}       % entry one
         &\multicolumn{1}{|r|}{x}  % entry two
         &\multicolumn{1}{|r}{y}   % entry three
         &z                        % entry four
     \end{tabular}
   Before the first entry the output will not have a vertical rule
because the '\multicolumn' has the COLS specifier 'r' with no initial
vertical bar.  Between entry one and entry two there will be a vertical
rule; although the first COLS does not have an ending vertical bar, the
second COLS does have a starting one.  Between entry two and entry three
there is a single vertical rule; despite that the COLS in both of the
surrounding 'multicolumn''s call for a vertical rule, you only get one
rule.  Between entry three and entry four there is no vertical rule; the
default calls for one but the COLS in the entry three '\multicolumn'
leaves it out, and that takes precedence.  Finally, following entry four
there is a vertical rule because of the default.

   The number of spanned columns NUMCOLS can be 1.  Besides giving the
ability to change the horizontal alignment, this also is useful to
override for one row the 'tabular' definition's default intercolumn area
specification, including the placement of vertical rules.

   In the example below, in the 'tabular' definition the first column is
specified to default to left justified but in the first row the entry is
centered with '\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}'.  Also in the first
row, the second and third columns are spanned by a single entry with
'\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}}', overriding the specification to
center those two columns on the page range en-dash.

     \begin{tabular}{l|r@{--}l}
       \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textsc{Period}}
         &multicolumn{2}{c}{\textsc{Span}} \\ \hline
       Baroque          &1600           &1760         \\
       Classical        &1730           &1820         \\
       Romantic         &1780           &1910         \\
       Impressionistic  &1875           &1925
     \end{tabular}

   Note that although the 'tabular' specification by default puts a
vertical rule between the first and second columns, because there is no
vertical bar in the COLS of either of the first row's '\multicolumn'
commands, no rule appears in the first row.

8.23.2 '\vline'
---------------

Draw a vertical line in a 'tabular' or 'array' environment extending the
full height and depth of an entry's row.  Can also be used in an
@-expression, although its synonym vertical bar '|' is more common.
This command is rarely used; typically a table's vertical lines are
specified in 'tabular''s COLS argument and overriden as needed with
'\multicolumn'.

   This example illustrates some pitfalls.  In the first line's second
entry the '\hfill' moves the '\vline' to the left edge of the cell.  But
that is different than putting it halfway between the two columns, so in
that row between the first and second columns there are two vertical
rules, with the one from the '{c|cc}' specifier coming before the one
produced by the '\vline\hfill'.  In contrast, the first line's third
entry shows the usual way to put a vertical bar between two columns.  In
the second line, the 'ghi' is the widest entry in its column so in the
'\vline\hfill' the '\hfill' has no effect and the vertical line in that
entry appears immediately next to the 'g', with no whitespace.

     \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
       x   &\vline\hfill y   &\multicolumn{1}{|r}{z} \\
       abc &def &\vline\hfill ghi

Synopsis:

     \cline{I-J}

   Draw a horizontal rule in an 'array' or 'tabular' environment
beginning in column I and ending in column J.  The dash '-' must appear
in the mandatory argument.  To span a single column use the number
twice.

   This example puts two horizontal lines between the first and second
rows, one line in the first column only, and the other spanning the
third and fourth columns.  The two lines are side-by-side, at the same
height.

     \begin{tabular}{llrr}
       a &b &c &d \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-4}

8.23.4 '\hline'
---------------

Draws a horizontal line the width of the enclosing 'tabular' or 'array'
environment.  It's most commonly used to draw a line at the top, bottom,
and between the rows of a table.

   In this example the top of the table has two horizontal rules, one
above the other, that span both columns.  The bottom of the table has a
single rule spanning both columns.  Because of the '\hline', the
'tabular' second row's line ending double backslash '\\' is required.

     \begin{tabular}{ll} \hline\hline

======================

Synopsis:

     \begin{thebibliography}{WIDEST-LABEL}
     \bibitem[LABEL]{CITE_KEY}
     ...
     \end{thebibliography}

   The 'thebibliography' environment produces a bibliography or
reference list.

   In the 'article' class, this reference list is labelled "References";
in the 'report' class, it is labelled "Bibliography".  You can change
the label (in the standard classes) by redefining the command
'\refname'.  For instance, this eliminates it entirely:

     \renewcommand{\refname}{}

   The mandatory WIDEST-LABEL argument is text that, when typeset, is as
wide as the widest item label produced by the '\bibitem' commands.  It
is typically given as '9' for bibliographies with less than 10
references, '99' for ones with less than 100, etc.

* Menu:

* \bibitem::            Specify a bibliography item.
* \cite::               Refer to a bibliography item.
* \nocite::             Include an item in the bibliography.

8.24.1 '\bibitem'
-----------------

Synopsis:

     \bibitem[LABEL]{CITE_KEY}

   The '\bibitem' command generates an entry labelled by LABEL.  If the
LABEL argument is missing, a number is automatically generated using the
'enumi' counter.  The CITE_KEY is a "citation key" consisting in any
sequence of letters, numbers, and punctuation symbols not containing a
comma.

   This command writes an entry to the '.aux' file containing the item's
CITE_KEY and LABEL.  When the '.aux' file is read by the
'\begin{document}' command, the item's LABEL is associated with
'cite_key', causing references to CITE_KEY with a '\cite' command (*note
\cite::) to produce the associated LABEL.

--------------

Synopsis:

     \cite[SUBCITE]{KEYS}

   The KEYS argument is a list of one or more citation keys (*note
\bibitem::), separated by commas.  This command generates an in-text
citation to the references associated with KEYS by entries in the '.aux'
file.

   The text of the optional SUBCITE argument appears after the citation.
For example, '\cite[p.~314]{knuth}' might produce '[Knuth, p. 314]'.

8.24.4 Using BibTeX
-------------------

If you use the BibTeX program by Oren Patashnik (highly recommended if
you need a bibliography of more than a couple of titles) to maintain
your bibliography, you don't use the 'thebibliography' environment
(*note thebibliography::).  Instead, you include the lines

     \bibliographystyle{BIBSTYLE}
     \bibliography{BIBFILE1,BIBFILE2}

   The '\bibliographystyle' command does not produce any output of its
own.  Rather, it defines the style in which the bibliography will be
produced: BIBSTYLE refers to a file BIBSTYLE'.bst', which defines how
your citations will look.  The standard BIBSTYLE names distributed with
BibTeX are:

'alpha'
     Sorted alphabetically.  Labels are formed from name of author and
     year of publication.
'plain'
     Sorted alphabetically.  Labels are numeric.
'unsrt'
     Like 'plain', but entries are in order of citation.
'abbrv'
     Like 'plain', but more compact labels.

   In addition, numerous other BibTeX style files exist tailored to the
demands of various publications.  See
<http://mirror.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib>.

   The '\bibliography' command is what actually produces the
bibliography.  The argument to '\bibliography' refers to files named
'BIBFILE1.bib', 'BIBFILE2.bib', ..., which should contain your database
in BibTeX format.  Only the entries referred to via '\cite' and
'\nocite' will be listed in the bibliography.

   Create a title page, a page with no printed page number or heading.
The following page will be numbered page one.

   To instead produce a standard title page without a 'titlepage'
environment you can use '\maketitle' (*note \maketitle::).

   Notice in this example that all formatting, including vertical

8.27 'verbatim'
===============

Synopsis:

     \begin{verbatim}
     LITERAL-TEXT
     \end{verbatim}

   The 'verbatim' environment is a paragraph-making environment in which
LaTeX produces exactly what you type in; for instance the '\' character
produces a printed '\'.  It turns LaTeX into a typewriter with carriage
returns and blanks having the same effect that they would on a
typewriter.

   The 'verbatim' uses a monospaced typewriter-like font ('\tt').

* Menu:

* \verb::       The macro form of the 'verbatim' environment.

8.27.1 '\verb'
--------------

Synopsis:

     \verbCHARLITERAL-TEXTCHAR
     \verb*CHARLITERAL-TEXTCHAR

   The '\verb' command typesets LITERAL-TEXT as it is input, including
special characters and spaces, using the typewriter ('\tt') font.  No
spaces are allowed between '\verb' or '\verb*' and the delimiter CHAR,
which begins and ends the verbatim text.  The delimiter must not appear
in LITERAL-TEXT.

   The '*'-form differs only in that spaces are printed with a "visible
space" character.

============

Synopsis:

     \begin{verse}
     LINE1 \\
     LINE2 \\
     ...
     \end{verse}

   The 'verse' environment is designed for poetry, though you may find
other uses for it.

   The margins are indented on the left and the right, paragraphs are
not indented, and the text is not justified.  Separate the lines of each
stanza with '\\', and use one or more blank lines to separate the
stanzas.

9 Line breaking
***************

The first thing LaTeX does when processing ordinary text is to translate
your input file into a sequence of glyphs and spaces.  To produce a
printed document, this sequence must be broken into lines (and these
lines must be broken into pages).

   LaTeX usually does the line (and page) breaking in the text body for
you but in some environments you manually force line breaks.

* Menu:

* \\::                         Start a new line.
* \obeycr & \restorecr::       Make each input line start a new output line.
* \newline::                   Break the line
* \- (hyphenation)::           Insert explicit hyphenation.
* \fussy::                     Be fussy about line breaking.

9.1 '\\'
========

Synopsis:

     \\[MORESPACE]

   or

     \\*[MORESPACE]

   Start a new line.  The optional argument MORESPACE specifies extra
vertical space to be insert before the next line.  This can be a
negative length.  The text before the break is set at its normal length,
that is, it is not stretched to fill out the line width.

   Explicit line breaks in the text body are unusual in LaTeX.  In
particular, to start a new paragraph instead leave a blank line.  This
command is mostly used outside of the main flow of text such as in a
'tabular' or 'array' environment.

   Under ordinary circumstances (e.g., outside of a 'p{...}' column in a
'tabular' environment) the '\newline' command is a synonym for '\\'
(*note \newline::).

   In addition to starting a new line, the starred form '\\*' tells
LaTeX not to start a new page between the two lines, by issuing a
'\nobreak'.

     \title{My story: \\[0.25in]
            a tale of woe}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \obeycr & \restorecr,  Next: \newline,  Prev: \\,  Up: Line breaking

9.2 '\obeycr' & '\restorecr'
============================

The '\obeycr' command makes a return in the input file ('^^M',
internally) the same as '\\' (followed by '\relax').  So each new line
in the input will also be a new line in the output.

   '\restorecr' restores normal line-breaking behavior.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \newline,  Next: \- (hyphenation),  Prev: \obeycr & \restorecr,  Up: Line breaking

9.3 '\newline'
==============

In ordinary text this is equivalent to double-backslash (*note \\::); it
breaks a line, with no stretching of the text before it.

   Inside a 'tabular' or 'array' environment, in a column with a
specifier producing a paragraph box, like typically 'p{...}', '\newline'
will insert a line break inside of the column, that is, it does not
break the entire row.  To break the entire row use '\\' or its
equivalent '\tabularnewline'.

   This will print 'Name:' and 'Address:' as two lines in a single cell
of the table.

     \begin{tabular}{p{1in}{\hspace{2in}}p{1in}}
       Name: \newline Address: &Date: \\ \hline
     \end{tabular}

   The 'Date:' will be baseline-aligned with 'Name:'.

9.4 '\-' (discretionary hyphen)
===============================

The '\-' command tells LaTeX that it may hyphenate the word at that
point.  LaTeX is pretty good at hyphenating, and usually finds most of
the correct hyphenation points, while almost never using an incorrect
one.  The '\-' command is used for the exceptional cases.

   When you insert '\-' commands in a word, the word will only be
hyphenated at those points and not at any of the hyphenation points that
LaTeX might otherwise have chosen.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \fussy,  Next: \sloppy,  Prev: \- (hyphenation),  Up: Line breaking

9.5 '\fussy'
============

The declaration '\fussy' (which is the default) makes TeX picky about
line breaking.  This usually avoids too much space between words, at the
cost of an occasional overfull box.

   This command cancels the effect of a previous '\sloppy' command
(*note \sloppy::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \sloppy,  Next: \hyphenation,  Prev: \fussy,  Up: Line breaking

9.6 '\sloppy'
=============

The declaration '\sloppy' makes TeX less fussy about line breaking.
This will avoid overfull boxes, at the cost of loose interword spacing.

9.7 '\hyphenation'
==================

Synopsis:

     \hyphenation{WORD-ONE WORD-TWO}

   The '\hyphenation' command declares allowed hyphenation points with a
'-' character in the given words.  The words are separated by spaces.
TeX will only hyphenate if the word matches exactly, no inflections are
tried.  Multiple '\hyphenation' commands accumulate.  Some examples (the
default TeX hyphenation patterns misses the hyphenations in these
words):

     \hyphenation{ap-pen-dix col-umns data-base data-bases}

9.8 '\linebreak' & '\nolinebreak'
=================================

Synopses:

     \linebreak[PRIORITY]
     \nolinebreak[PRIORITY]

   By default, the '\linebreak' ('\nolinebreak') command forces
(prevents) a line break at the current position.  For '\linebreak', the
spaces in the line are stretched out so that it extends to the right
margin as usual.

   With the optional argument PRIORITY, you can convert the command from
a demand to a request.  The PRIORITY must be a number from 0 to 4.  The
higher the number, the more insistent the request.

10 Page breaking
****************

LaTeX starts new pages asynchronously, when enough material has
accumulated to fill up a page.  Usually this happens automatically, but
sometimes you may want to influence the breaks.

* Menu:

* \cleardoublepage::           Start a new right-hand page.
* \clearpage::                 Start a new page.
* \newpage::                   Start a new page.
* \enlargethispage::           Enlarge the current page a bit.
* \pagebreak & \nopagebreak::  Forcing & avoiding page breaks.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \cleardoublepage,  Next: \clearpage,  Up: Page breaking

10.1 '\cleardoublepage'
=======================

The '\cleardoublepage' command ends the current page and causes all the
pending floating figures and tables that have so far appeared in the
input to be printed.  In a two-sided printing style, it also makes the
next page a right-hand (odd-numbered) page, producing a blank page if
necessary.

10.4 '\enlargethispage'
=======================

'\enlargethispage{size}'

   '\enlargethispage*{size}'

   Enlarge the '\textheight' for the current page by the specified
amount; e.g., '\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}' will allow one
additional line.

   The starred form tries to squeeze the material together on the page
as much as possible.  This is normally used together with an explicit
'\pagebreak'.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \pagebreak & \nopagebreak,  Prev: \enlargethispage,  Up: Page breaking

10.5 '\pagebreak' & '\nopagebreak'
==================================

Synopses:

     \pagebreak[PRIORITY]
     \nopagebreak[PRIORITY]

   By default, the '\pagebreak' ('\nopagebreak') command forces
(prevents) a page break at the current position.  With '\pagebreak', the
vertical space on the page is stretched out where possible so that it
extends to the normal bottom margin.

   With the optional argument PRIORITY, you can convert the '\pagebreak'
command from a demand to a request.  The number must be a number from 0
to 4.  The higher the number, the more insistent the request is.

************

Place a numbered footnote at the bottom of the current page, as here.

     Noe"l Coward quipped that having to read a footnote is like having
     to go downstairs to answer the door, while in the midst of making
     love.\footnote{I wouldn't know, I don't read footnotes.}

   You can place multiple footnotes on a page.  If the text becomes too
long it will flow to the next page.

   You can also produce footnotes by combining the '\footnotemark' and
the '\footnotetext' commands, which is useful in special circumstances.

   To make bibliographic references come out as footnotes you need to
include a bibliographic style with that behavior.

* Menu:

* \footnote::                Insert a footnote.
* \footnotemark::            Insert footnote mark only.
* \footnotetext::            Insert footnote text only.
* Footnotes in a table::     Table footnotes.
* Footnotes in section headings::     Chapter or section titles.

11.1 '\footnote'
================

Synopsis:

     \footnote[NUMBER]{TEXT}

   Place a numbered footnote TEXT at the bottom of the current page.

     There are over a thousand footnotes in Gibbon's
     \textit{Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire}.\footnote{After
     reading an early version with endnotes David Hume complained,
     ``One is also plagued with his Notes, according to the present Method
     of printing the Book'' and suggested that they ``only to be printed
     at the Margin or the Bottom of the Page.''}

   The optional argument NUMBER allows you to specify the footnote
number.  If you use this option then the footnote number counter is not
incremented, and if you do not use it then the counter is incremented.

   Change how LaTeX shows the footnote counter with something like
'\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}', which uses a
sequence of symbols (*note \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman
\fnsymbol::).  To make this change global put that in the preamble.  If
you make the change local then you may want to reset the counter with
'\setcounter{footnote}{0}'.  By default LaTeX uses arabic numbers.

   LaTeX's default puts many restrictions on where you can use a
'\footnote'; for instance, you cannot use it in an argument to a
sectioning command such as '\chapter' (it can only be used in outer
paragraph mode).  There are some workarounds; see following sections.

   In a 'minipage' environment the '\footnote' command uses the
'mpfootnote' counter instead of the 'footnote' counter, so they are
numbered independently.  They are shown at the bottom of the
environment, not at the bottom of the page.  And by default they are
shown alphabetically.  *Note minipage::.

11.2 '\footnotemark'
====================

Synopsis, one of:

     \footnotemark
     \footnotemark[NUMBER]

   Put the current footnote number in the text.  (See *note
\footnotetext:: for giving the text of the footnote separately.)  The
version with the optional argument NUMBER uses that number to determine
the mark printed.  This command can be used in inner paragraph mode.

   This example gives the same institutional affiliation to both the
first and third authors ('\thanks' is a version of 'footnote').

     \title{A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem}

       \and A C Doyle\thanks{Durham University}
       \and S Holmes\footnotemark[1]}
     \begin{document}
     \maketitle

   If you use '\footnotemark' without the optional argument then it
increments the footnote counter but if you use the optional NUMBER then
it does not.  This produces several consecutive footnote markers
referring to the same footnote.

Synopsis, one of:

     \footnotetext{TEXT}
     \footnotetext[NUMBER]{TEXT}

   Place TEXT at the bottom of the page as a footnote.  This command can
come anywhere after the '\footnotemark' command.  The optional argument
NUMBER changes the displayed footnote number.  The '\footnotetext'
command must appear in outer paragraph mode.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Footnotes in a table,  Next: Footnotes in section headings,  Prev: \footnotetext,  Up: Footnotes

11.4 Footnotes in a table
=========================

Inside a 'table' environment the '\footnote' command does not work.  For
instance, if the code below appears on its own then the footnote simply
disappears; there is a footnote mark in the table cell but nothing is
set at the bottom of the page.

     \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}{l|l}
          \textsc{Ship}  &\textsc{Book} \\ \hline
          \textit{HMS Sophie}     &Master and Commander  \\
          \textit{HMS Polychrest} &Post Captain  \\
          \textit{HMS Lively}     &Post Captain \\
          \textit{HMS Surprise}   &A number of books\footnote{Starting with HMS Surprise.}
          \end{tabular}
     \end{center}

   The solution is to surround the 'tabular' environment with a
'minipage' environment, as here (*note minipage::).

     \begin{center}
       \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
         .. tabular material ..
       \end{minipage}
     \end{center}

   The same technique will work inside a floating 'table' environment
(*note table::).  To get the footnote at the bottom of the page use the
'tablefootnote' package, as illustrated in this example.  If you put
'\usepackage{tablefootnote}' in the preamble and use the code shown then
the footnote appears at the bottom and is numbered in sequence with
other footnotes.

     \begin{table}
       \centering
          \begin{tabular}{l|l}
          \textsc{Date}  &\textsc{Campaign} \\ \hline

11.5 Footnotes in section headings
==================================

Putting a footnote in a section heading

     \section{Full sets\protect\footnote{This material is due to R~Jones.}}

   causes the footnote to appear both at the bottom of the page where
the section starts and at the bottom of the table of contents page.  To
have it not appear on the table of contents use the package 'footmisc'
with the 'stable' option.

     \usepackage[stable]{footmisc}
      ..
     \begin{document}
      ..
     \section{Full sets\footnote{This material is due to R~Jones.}}

   Note that the '\protect' is gone; putting it in causes the footnote
to reappear on the table of contents.

11.6 Footnotes of footnotes
===========================

Particularly in the humanities, authors can have multiple classes of
footnotes, including having footnotes of footnotes.  The package
'bigfoot' extends LaTeX's default footnote mechanism in many ways,
including allow these two, as in this example.

     \usepackage{bigfoot}
     \DeclareNewFootnote{Default}
     \DeclareNewFootnote{from}[alph]   % create class \footnotefrom{}

11.7 Multiple references to footnotes
=====================================

You can refer to a single footnote more than once.  This example uses
the package 'cleverref'.

     \usepackage{cleveref}[2012/02/15]   % this version of package or later
     \crefformat{footnote}{#2\footnotemark[#1]#3}
       ..
     \begin{document}
       ..
     The theorem is from Evers.\footnote{\label{fn:TE}Tinker and Evers, 1994.}
     The corollary is from Chance.\footnote{Evers and Chance, 1990.}
     But the key lemma is from Tinker.\cref{fn:TE}
       ..

   This solution will work with the package 'hyperref'.  See *note
\footnotemark:: for a simpler solution in the common case of multiple
authors with the same affiliation.

11.8 Footnote parameters
========================

'\footnoterule'
     Produces the rule separating the main text on a page from the
     page's footnotes.  Default dimensions: '0.4pt' thick (or wide), and
     '0.4\columnwidth' long in the standard document classes (except
     'slides', where it does not appear).

'\footnotesep'
     The height of the strut placed at the beginning of the footnote.
     By default, this is set to the normal strut for '\footnotesize'
     fonts (*note Font sizes::), therefore there is no extra space
     between footnotes.  This is '6.65pt' for '10pt', '7.7pt' for
     '11pt', and '8.4pt' for '12pt'.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: \newcommand & \renewcommand,  Next: \providecommand,  Up: Definitions

12.1 '\newcommand' & '\renewcommand'
====================================

'\newcommand' and '\renewcommand' define and redefine a command,
respectively.  Synopses:

       \newcommand{CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}
       \newcommand*{CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}
     \renewcommand{CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}
     \renewcommand*{CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

   The starred form of these two commands requires that the arguments
not contain multiple paragraphs of text (not '\long', in plain TeX
terms).

CMD
     Required; the command name.  It must begin with '\'.  For
     '\newcommand', it must not be already defined and must not begin
     with '\end'.  For '\renewcommand', it must already be defined.

NARGS
     Optional; an integer from 0 to 9, specifying the number of
     arguments that the command will take.  If this argument is not
     present, the default is for the command to have no arguments.  When
     redefining a command, the new version can have a different number
     of arguments than the old version.

OPTARGDEFAULT
     Optional; if this argument is present then the first argument of
     defined command \CMD is optional, with default value OPTARGDEFAULT
     (which may be the empty string).  If this argument is not present
     then \CMD does not take an optional argument.

     That is, if \CMD is used with square brackets following, as in
     '\CMD[MYVAL]', then within DEFN the first "positional parameter"
     '#1' expands MYVAL.  While if \CMD is called without square
     brackets following, then within DEFN the positional parameter '#1'
     expands to the default OPTARGDEFAULT.  In either case, any required
     arguments will be referred to starting with '#2'.

     Omitting '[MYVAL]' in the call is different from having the square
     brackets with no contents, as in '[]'.  The former results in '#1'
     expanding to OPTARGDEFAULT; the latter results in '#1' expanding to
     the empty string.

DEFN
     The text to be substituted for every occurrence of 'cmd'; the
     positional parameter '#N' in DEFN is replaced by the text of the
     Nth argument.

   A command with no arguments that is followed in the source by a space
will swallow that space.  The solution is to type '{}' after the command
and before the space.

   A simple example of defining a new command: '\newcommand{\JH}{Jim
Hef{}feron}' causes the abbreviation '\JH' to be replaced by the longer
text.

   Redefining a command is basically the same:
'\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{{\small QED}}'.

   Here's a command definition that uses arguments:

     \newcommand{\defreference}[1]{Definition~\ref{#1}}

Then, '\defreference{def:basis}' will expand to something like
'Definition~3.14'.

   An example with two arguments:
'\newcommand{\nbym}[2]{#1\!\times\!#2}' is invoked as '\nbym{2}{k}'.

   An example with optional arguments:

     \newcommand{\salutation}[1][Sir or Madam]{Dear #1:}

Then, '\salutation' gives 'Dear Sir or Madam:' while '\salutation[John]'
gives 'Dear John:'.  And '\salutation[]' gives 'Dear :'.

   The braces around DEFN do not delimit the scope of the result of
expanding DEFN.  So '\newcommand{\shipname}[1]{\it #1}' is wrong since
in the sentence

     The \shipname{Monitor} met the \shipname{Virginia}.

the words 'met the' will incorrectly be in italics.  An extra pair of
braces '\newcommand{\shipname}[1]{{\it #1}}' fixes it.

12.2 '\providecommand'
======================

Defines a command, as long as no command of this name already exists.
Synopses:

     \providecommand{CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}
     \providecommand*{CMD}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{DEFN}

   If no command of this name already exists then this has the same
effect as '\newcommand' (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::).  If a
command of this name already exists then this definition does nothing.
This is particularly useful in a style file, or other file that may be
loaded more than once.

12.3 '\newcounter': Allocating a counter
========================================

Synopsis, one of:

     \newcounter{COUNTERNAME}
     \newcounter{COUNTERNAME}[SUPERCOUNTER]

   Globally defines a new counter named COUNTERNAME and initialize the
new counter to zero.

   The name COUNTERNAME must consists of letters only, and does not
begin with a backslash.  This name must not already be in use by another
counter.

   When you use the optional argument '[SUPERCOUNTER]' then COUNTERNAME
will be numbered within, or subsidiary to, the existing counter
SUPERCOUNTER.  For example, ordinarily 'subsection' is numbered within
'section' so that any time SUPERCOUNTER is incremented with
'\stepcounter' (*note \stepcounter::) or '\refstepcounter' (*note
\refstepcounter::) then COUNTERNAME is reset to zero.

   *Note Counters::, for more information about counters.

12.4 '\newlength': Allocating a length
======================================

Allocate a new "length" register.  Synopsis:

     \newlength{\ARG}

   This command takes one required argument, which must begin with a
backslash ('\').  It creates a new length register named '\ARG', which
is a place to hold (rubber) lengths such as '1in plus.2in minus.1in'
(what plain TeX calls a 'skip' register).  The register gets an initial
value of zero.  The control sequence '\ARG' must not already be defined.

   *Note Lengths::, for more about lengths.

12.5 '\newsavebox': Allocating a box
====================================

Allocate a "bin" for holding a box.  Synopsis:

     \newsavebox{\CMD}

   Defines '\CMD' to refer to a new bin for storing boxes.  Such a box
is for holding typeset material, to use multiple times (*note Boxes::)
or to measure or manipulate.  The name '\CMD' must start with a
backslash ('\'), and must not be already defined.

   The allocation of a box is global.  This command is fragile (*note
\protect::).

12.6 '\newenvironment' & '\renewenvironment'
============================================

These commands define or redefine an environment ENV, that is,
'\begin{ENV} BODY \end{ENV}'.  Synopses:

       \newenvironment{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEFN}{ENDDEFN}
       \newenvironment*{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEFN}{ENDDEFN}
     \renewenvironment{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEFN}{ENDDEFN}
     \renewenvironment*{ENV}[NARGS][OPTARGDEFAULT]{BEGDEFN}{ENDDEFN}

   The starred form of these commands requires that the arguments not
contain multiple paragraphs of text.  The body of these environments can
still contain multiple paragraphs.

ENV
     Required; the environment name.  It consists only of letters or the
     '*' character, and thus does not begin with backslash ('\').  It
     must not begin with the string 'end'.  For '\newenvironment', the
     name ENV must not be the name of an already existing environment,
     and also the command '\ENV' must be undefined.  For
     '\renewenvironment', ENV must be the name of an existing
     environment.

NARGS
     Optional; an integer from 0 to 9 denoting the number of arguments
     of that the environment will take.  When the environment is used
     these arguments appear after the '\begin', as in
     '\begin{ENV}{ARG1}...{ARGN}'.  If this argument is not present then
     the default is for the environment to have no arguments.  When
     redefining an environment, the new version can have a different
     number of arguments than the old version.

OPTARGDEFAULT
     Optional; if this argument is present then the first argument of
     the defined environment is optional, with default value
     OPTARGDEFAULT (which may be the empty string).  If this argument is
     not present then the environment does not take an optional
     argument.

     That is, when '[OPTARGDEFAULT]' is present in the environment
     definition, if '\begin{ENV}' is used with square brackets
     following, as in '\begin{ENV}[MYVAL]', then, within BEGDEFN, the
     positional parameter '#1' expands to MYVAL.  If '\begin{ENV}' is
     called without square brackets following, then, within within
     BEGDEFN, the positional parameter '#1' expands to the default
     OPTARGDEFAULT.  In either case, any required arguments will be
     referred to starting with '#2'.

     Omitting '[MYVAL]' in the call is different from having the square
     brackets with no contents, as in '[]'.  The former results in '#1'
     expanding to OPTARGDEFAULT; the latter results in '#1' expanding to
     the empty string.

BEGDEFN
     Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of '\begin{ENV}'; a
     construct of the form '#N' in BEGDEF is replaced by the text of the
     Nth argument.

ENDDEFN
     Required; the text expanded at every occurrence of '\end{ENV}'.
     Note that it may not contain any argument parameters, so '#N'
     cannot be used here (but see the final example below).

   The environment ENV delimits the scope of the result of expanding
BEGDEFN and ENDDEFN.  Thus, in the first example below, the effect of
the '\small' is limited to the quote and does not extend to material
following the environment.

   This example gives an environment like LaTeX's 'quotation' except
that it will be set in smaller type.

     \newenvironment{smallquote}{%
       \small\begin{quotation}
     }{%
       \end{quotation}
     }

   This shows the use of arguments; it gives a quotation environment
that cites the author.

     \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%
       \begin{quotation}
       \noindent\textit{#1}:
     }{%
       \end{quotation}
     }

The author's name is optional, and defaults to 'Shakespeare'.  In the
document, use the environment as here:

     \begin{citequote}[Lincoln]
       ..
     \end{citequote}

   The final example shows how to save the value of an argument to use
in ENDDEFN.

     \newsavebox{\quoteauthor}
     \newenvironment{citequote}[1][Shakespeare]{%
       \sbox\quoteauthor{#1}%
       \begin{quotation}
     }{%
       \hspace{1em plus 1fill}---\usebox{\quoteauthor}
       \end{quotation}
     }

12.7 '\newtheorem'
==================

Define a new theorem-like environment.  Synopses:

     \newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}
     \newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}[NUMBERED_WITHIN]
     \newtheorem{NAME}[NUMBERED_LIKE]{TITLE}

   Using the first form, '\newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}' creates an
environment that will be labelled with TITLE.  See the first example
below.

   The second form '\newtheorem{NAME}{TITLE}[NUMBERED_WITHIN]' creates
an environment whose counter is subordinate to the existing counter
NUMBERED_WITHIN (its counter will be reset when NUMBERED_WITHIN is
reset).

   The third form '\newtheorem{NAME}[NUMBERED_LIKE]{TITLE}', with
optional argument between the two required arguments, will create an
environment whose counter will share the previously defined counter
NUMBERED_LIKE.

   You can specify one of NUMBERED_WITHIN and NUMBERED_LIKE, or neither,
but not both.

   This command creates a counter named NAME.  In addition, unless the
optional argument NUMBERED_LIKE is used, inside of the theorem-like
environment the current '\ref' value will be that of
'\theNUMBERED_WITHIN' (*note \ref::).

   This declaration is global.  It is fragile (*note \protect::).

   Arguments:

NAME
     The name of the environment.  It must not begin with a backslash
     ('\').  It must not be the name of an existing environment; indeed,
     the command name '\NAME' must not already be defined as anything.

TITLE
     The text printed at the beginning of the environment, before the
     number.  For example, 'Theorem'.

NUMBERED_WITHIN
     Optional; the name of an already defined counter, usually a
     sectional unit such as 'chapter' or 'section'.  When the
     NUMBERED_WITHIN counter is reset then the NAME environment's
     counter will also be reset.

     If this optional argument is not used then the command '\theNAME'
     is set to '\arabic{NAME}'.

NUMBERED_LIKE
     Optional; the name of an already defined theorem-like environment.
     The new environment will be numbered in sequence with
     NUMBERED_LIKE.

   Without any optional arguments the environments are numbered
sequentially.  The example below has a declaration in the preamble that
results in 'Definition 1' and 'Definition 2' in the output.

     \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}
     \begin{document}
     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       First def
     \end{defn}

     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       Second def
     \end{defn}

   Because the next example specifies the optional argument
NUMBERED_WITHIN to '\newtheorem' as 'section', the example, with the
same document body, gives 'Definition 1.1' and 'Definition 2.1'.

     \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}[section]
     \begin{document}
     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       First def
     \end{defn}

     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       Second def
     \end{defn}

   In the next example there are two declarations in the preamble, the
second of which calls for the new 'thm' environment to use the same
counter as 'defn'.  It gives 'Definition 1.1', followed by 'Theorem 2.1'
and 'Definition 2.2'.

     \newtheorem{defn}{Definition}[section]
     \newtheorem{thm}[defn]{Theorem}
     \begin{document}
     \section{...}
     \begin{defn}
       First def
     \end{defn}

     \section{...}
     \begin{thm}
       First thm
     \end{thm}

     \begin{defn}
       Second def
     \end{defn}

12.8 '\newfont': Define a new font (obsolete)
=============================================

'\newfont', now obsolete, defines a command that will switch fonts.
Synopsis:

     \newfont{\CMD}{FONT DESCRIPTION}

   This defines a control sequence '\CMD' that will change the current
font.  LaTeX will look on your system for a file named 'FONTNAME.tfm'.
The control sequence must must not already be defined.  It must begin
with a backslash ('\').

   This command is obsolete.  It is a low-level command for setting up
an individual font.  Today fonts are almost always defined in families
(which allows you to, for example, associate a boldface with a roman)
through the so-called "New Font Selection Scheme", either by using '.fd'
files or through the use of an engine that can access system fonts such
as XeLaTeX (*note TeX engines::).

   But since it is part of LaTeX, here is an explanation: the FONT
DESCRIPTION consists of a FONTNAME and an optional "at clause"; this can
have the form either 'at DIMEN' or 'scaled FACTOR', where a FACTOR of
'1000' means no scaling.  For LaTeX's purposes, all this does is scale
all the character and other font dimensions relative to the font's
design size, which is a value defined in the '.tfm' file.

   This example defines two equivalent fonts and typesets a few
characters in each:

     \newfont{\testfontat}{cmb10 at 11pt}
     \newfont{\testfontscaled}{cmb10 scaled 1100}
     \testfontat abc
     \testfontscaled abc


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \protect,  Prev: \newfont,  Up: Definitions

12.9 '\protect'
===============

All LaTeX commands are either "fragile" or "robust".  Footnotes, line
breaks, any command that has an optional argument, and many more, are
fragile.  A fragile command can break when it is used in the argument to
certain commands.  To prevent such commands from breaking they must be
preceded by the command '\protect'.

   For example, when LaTeX runs the '\section{SECTION NAME}' command it
writes the SECTION NAME text to the '.aux' auxiliary file, moving it
there for use elsewhere in the document such as in the table of
contents.  Any argument that is internally expanded by LaTeX without
typesetting it directly is referred to as a "moving argument".  A
command is fragile if it can expand during this process into invalid TeX
code.  Some examples of moving arguments are those that appear in the
'\caption{...}' command (*note figure::), in the '\thanks{...}' command
(*note \maketitle::), and in @-expressions in the 'tabular' and 'array'
environments (*note tabular::).

   If you get strange errors from commands used in moving arguments, try
preceding it with '\protect'.  Every fragile commands must be protected
with their own '\protect'.

   Although usually a '\protect' command doesn't hurt, length commands
are robust and should not be preceded by a '\protect' command.  Nor can
a '\protect' command be used in the argument to '\addtocounter' or
'\setcounter' command.

   In this example the 'caption' command gives a mysterious error about
an extra curly brace.  Fix the problem by preceding each '\raisebox'
command with '\protect'.

     \begin{figure}
       ..
       \caption{Company headquarters of A\raisebox{1pt}{B}\raisebox{-1pt}{C}}
     \end{figure}

   In the next example the '\tableofcontents' command gives an error
because the '\(..\)' in the section title expands to illegal TeX in the
'.toc' file.  You can solve this by changing '\(..\)' to
'\protect\(..\protect\)'.

     \begin{document}
     \tableofcontents
      ..
     \section{Einstein's \( e=mc^2 \)}
      ..

13 Counters
***********

Everything LaTeX numbers for you has a counter associated with it.  The
name of the counter is often the same as the name of the environment or
command associated with the number, except that the counter's name has
no backslash '\'.  Thus, associated with the '\chapter' command is the
'chapter' counter that keeps track of the chapter number.

   Below is a list of the counters used in LaTeX's standard document
classes to control numbering.

     part            paragraph       figure          enumi
     chapter         subparagraph    table           enumii
     section         page            footnote        enumiii
     subsection      equation        mpfootnote      enumiv
     subsubsection

   The 'mpfootnote' counter is used by the '\footnote' command inside of
a minipage (*note minipage::).  The counters 'enumi' through 'enumiv'
are used in the 'enumerate' environment, for up to four levels of
nesting (*note enumerate::).

   New counters are created with '\newcounter'.  *Note \newcounter::.

* Menu:

* \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol:: Print value of a counter.
* \usecounter::       Use a specified counter in a list environment.
* \value::            Use the value of a counter in an expression.
* \setcounter::       Set the value of a counter.
* \addtocounter::     Add a quantity to a counter.
* \refstepcounter::   Add to a counter.
* \stepcounter::      Add to a counter, resetting subsidiary counters.
* \day \month \year:: Numeric date values.

13.1 '\alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol': Printing counters
=====================================================================

Print the value of a counter, in a specified style.  For instance, if
the counter COUNTER has the value 1 then a '\alph{COUNTER}' in your
source will result in a lower case letter a appearing in the output.

   All of these commands take a single counter as an argument, for
instance, '\alph{enumi}'.  Note that the counter name does not start
with a backslash.

'\alph{COUNTER}'
     Print the value of COUNTER in lowercase letters: 'a', 'b', ...

'\Alph{COUNTER}'
     Print in uppercase letters: 'A', 'B', ...

'\arabic{COUNTER}'
     Print in Arabic numbers: '1', '2', ...

'\roman{COUNTER}'
     Print in lowercase roman numerals: 'i', 'ii', ...

'\Roman{COUNTER}'
     Print in uppercase roman numerals: 'I', 'II', ...

'\fnsymbol{COUNTER}'
     Prints the value of COUNTER in a specific sequence of nine symbols
     (conventionally used for labeling footnotes).  The value of COUNTER
     must be between 1 and 9, inclusive.

     Here are the symbols (if you are reading this in ASCII output then
     you will see the Unicode code points):

          asterisk(*) dagger(U+2021) ddagger(U+2021)
          section-sign(U+00A7) paragraph-sign(U+00B6) parallel(U+2225)

13.2 '\usecounter{COUNTER}'
===========================

Synopsis:

     \usecounter{COUNTER}

   In the 'list' environment, when used in the second argument, this
command sets up COUNTER to number the list items.  It initializes
COUNTER to zero, and arranges that when '\item' is called without its
optional argument then COUNTER is incremented by '\refstepcounter',
making its value be the current 'ref' value.  This command is fragile
(*note \protect::).

   Put in the preamble, this makes a new list environment enumerated
with TESTCOUNTER:

     \newcounter{testcounter}
     \newenvironment{test}{%
       \begin{list}{}{%
         \usecounter{testcounter}
       }
     }{%
       \end{list}
     }

13.3 '\value{COUNTER}'
======================

Synopsis:

     \value{COUNTER}

   This command expands to the value of COUNTER.  It is often used in
'\setcounter' or '\addtocounter', but '\value' can be used anywhere that
LaTeX expects a number.  It must not be preceded by '\protect' (*note
\protect::).

   The '\value' command is not used for typesetting the value of the
counter.  *Note \alph \Alph \arabic \roman \Roman \fnsymbol::.

   This example outputs 'Test counter is 6. Other counter is 5.'.

     \newcounter{test} \setcounter{test}{5}
     \newcounter{other} \setcounter{other}{\value{test}}
     \addtocounter{test}{1}

     Test counter is \arabic{test}.
     Other counter is \arabic{other}.

   This example inserts '\hspace{4\parindent}'.

13.4 '\setcounter{COUNTER}{VALUE}'
==================================

Synopsis:

     \setcounter{COUNTER}{VALUE}

   The '\setcounter' command globally sets the value of COUNTER to the
VALUE argument.  Note that the counter name does not start with a
backslash.

   In this example the section value appears as 'V'.

     \setcounter{section}{5}
     Here it is in Roman: \Roman{section}.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addtocounter,  Next: \refstepcounter,  Prev: \setcounter,  Up: Counters

13.5 '\addtocounter{COUNTER}{VALUE}'
====================================

The '\addtocounter' command globally increments COUNTER by the amount
specified by the VALUE argument, which may be negative.

   In this example the section value appears as 'VII'.

     \setcounter{section}{5}
     \addtocounter{section}{2}
     Here it is in Roman: \Roman{section}.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \refstepcounter,  Next: \stepcounter,  Prev: \addtocounter,  Up: Counters

13.6 '\refstepcounter{COUNTER}'
===============================

The '\refstepcounter' command works in the same way as '\stepcounter'
(*note \stepcounter::): it globally increments the value of COUNTER by
one and resets the value of any counter numbered within it.  (For the
definition of "counters numbered within", *note \newcounter::.)

   In addition, this command also defines the current '\ref' value to be
the result of '\thecounter'.

   While the counter value is set globally, the '\ref' value is set
locally, i.e., inside the current group.

counters numbered within it.  (For the definition of "counters numbered
within", *note \newcounter::.)


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \day \month \year,  Prev: \stepcounter,  Up: Counters

13.8 '\day \month \year': Predefined counters
=============================================

LaTeX defines counters for the day of the month ('\day', 1-31), month of
the year ('\month', 1-12), and year ('\year', Common Era).  When TeX
starts up, they are set to the current values on the system where TeX is
running.  They are not updated as the job progresses.

   The related command '\today' produces a string representing the
current day (*note \today::).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Lengths,  Next: Making paragraphs,  Prev: Counters,  Up: Top

14 Lengths
**********

A "length" is a measure of distance.  Many LaTeX commands take a length
as an argument.

   Lengths come in two types.  A "rigid length" (what Plain TeX calls a
"dimen") such as '10pt' cannot contain a 'plus' or 'minus' component.  A
"rubber length" (what Plain TeX calls a "skip") can contain those, as
with '1cm plus0.05cm minus0.01cm'.  These give the ability to stretch or
shrink; the length in the prior sentence could appear in the output as
long as 1.05 cm or as short as 0.99 cm, depending on what TeX's
typesetting algorithm finds optimum.

   The 'plus' or 'minus' component of a rubber length can contain a
"fill" component, as in '1in plus2fill'.  This gives the length infinite
stretchability or shrinkability, so that the length in the prior
sentence can be set by TeX to any distance greater than or equal to
1 inch.  TeX actually provides three infinite glue components 'fil',
'fill', and 'filll', such that the later ones overcome the earlier ones,
but only the middle value is ordinarily used.  *Note \hfill::, *Note
\vfill::.

   Multiplying an entire rubber length by a number turns it into a rigid
length, so that after '\setlength{\ylength}{1in plus 0.2in}' and
'\setlength{\zlength}{3\ylength}' then the value of '\zlength' is '3in'.

* Menu:

* Units of length::     The units that LaTeX knows.
* \setlength::          Set the value of a length.
* \addtolength::        Add a quantity to a length.
* \settodepth::         Set a length to the depth of something.
* \settoheight::        Set a length to the height of something.
* \settowidth::         Set a length to the width of something.
* Predefined lengths::  Lengths that are, like, predefined.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Units of length,  Next: \setlength,  Up: Lengths

14.1 Units of length
====================

TeX and LaTeX know about these units both inside and outside of math
mode.

'pt'
     Point 1/72.27 inch.  The conversion to metric units, to two decimal
     places, is 1point = 2.85mm = 28.45cm.

'pc'
     Pica, 12 pt

'in'
     Inch, 72.27 pt

'bp'
     Big point, 1/72 inch.  This length is the definition of a point in
     PostScript and many desktop publishing systems.

'cm'
     Centimeter

'mm'
     Millimeter

'dd'
     Didot point, 1.07 pt

'cc'
     Cicero, 12 dd

'sp'
     Scaled point, 1/65536 pt

   Two other lengths that are often used are values set by the designer
of the font.  The x-height of the current font "ex", traditionally the
height of the lower case letter x, is often used for vertical lengths.
Similarly "em", traditionally the width of the capital letter M, is
often used for horizontal lengths (there is also '\enspace', which is
'0.5em').  Use of these can help make a definition work better across
font changes.  For example, a definition of the vertical space between
list items given as '\setlength{\itemsep}{1ex plus 0.05ex minus 0.01ex}'
is more likely to still be reasonable if the font is changed than a
definition given in points.

   In math mode, many definitions are expressed in terms of the math
unit "mu" given by 1 em = 18 mu, where the em is taken from the current
math symbols family.  *Note Spacing in math mode::.

15 Making paragraphs
********************

A paragraph is ended by one or more completely blank lines--lines not
containing even a '%'.  A blank line should not appear where a new
paragraph cannot be started, such as in math mode or in the argument of
a sectioning command.

* Menu:

* \indent::        Indent this paragraph.
* \noindent::      Do not indent this paragraph.
* \parskip::       Space added before paragraphs.
* Marginal notes:: Putting remarks in the margin.

15.1 '\indent'
==============

'\indent' produces a horizontal space whose width equals to the
'\parindent' length, the normal paragraph indentation.  It is used to
add paragraph indentation where it would otherwise be suppressed.

   The default value for '\parindent' is '1em' in two-column mode,
otherwise '15pt' for '10pt' documents, '17pt' for '11pt', and '1.5em'
for '12pt'.

================

When used at the beginning of the paragraph, this command suppresses any
paragraph indentation, as in this example.

     .. end of the prior paragraph.

     \noindent This paragraph is not indented.

   It has no effect when used in the middle of a paragraph.

   To eliminate paragraph indentation in an entire document, put
'\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}' in the preamble.

15.4 Marginal notes
===================

Synopsis:

     \marginpar[LEFT]{RIGHT}

   The '\marginpar' command creates a note in the margin.  The first
line of the note will have the same baseline as the line in the text
where the '\marginpar' occurs.

   When you only specify the mandatory argument RIGHT, the text will be
placed

   * in the right margin for one-sided layout (option 'oneside', see
     *note Document class options::);
   * in the outside margin for two-sided layout (option 'twoside', see
     *note Document class options::);
   * in the nearest margin for two-column layout (option 'twocolumn',
     see *note Document class options::).

   The command '\reversemarginpar' places subsequent marginal notes in
the opposite (inside) margin.  '\normalmarginpar' places them in the
default position.

   When you specify both arguments, LEFT is used for the left margin,
and RIGHT is used for the right margin.

   The first word will normally not be hyphenated; you can enable
hyphenation there by beginning the node with '\hspace{0pt}'.

   These parameters affect the formatting of the note:

'\marginparpush'
     Minimum vertical space between notes; default '7pt' for '12pt'
     documents, '5pt' else.

'\marginparsep'
     Horizontal space between the main text and the note; default '11pt'
     for '10pt' documents, '10pt' else.

'\marginparwidth'
     Width of the note itself; default for a one-sided '10pt' document
     is '90pt', '83pt' for '11pt', and '68pt' for '12pt'; '17pt' more in
     each case for a two-sided document.  In two column mode, the
     default is '48pt'.

   The standard LaTeX routine for marginal notes does not prevent notes
from falling off the bottom of the page.

16 Math formulas
****************

There are three environments that put LaTeX in math mode:

'math'
     For formulas that appear right in the text.
'displaymath'
     For formulas that appear on their own line.
'equation'
     The same as the displaymath environment except that it adds an
     equation number in the right margin.

   The 'math' environment can be used in both paragraph and LR mode, but
the 'displaymath' and 'equation' environments can be used only in
paragraph mode.  The 'math' and 'displaymath' environments are used so
often that they have the following short forms:

     \(...\)   instead of   \begin{math}...\end{math}
     \[...\]   instead of   \begin{displaymath}...\end{displaymath}

   In fact, the 'math' environment is so common that it has an even
shorter form:

     $ ... $   instead of   \(...\)

   The '\boldmath' command changes math letters and symbols to be in a
bold font.  It is used _outside_ of math mode.  Conversely, the
'\unboldmath' command changes math glyphs to be in a normal font; it too
is used _outside_ of math mode.

   The '\displaystyle' declaration forces the size and style of the
formula to be that of 'displaymath', e.g., with limits above and below
summations.  For example:

     $\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty x_n $

* Menu:

* Subscripts & superscripts::   Also known as exponent or index.
* Math symbols::                Various mathematical squiggles.
* Math functions::              Math function names like sin and exp.
* Math accents::                Accents in math.
* Spacing in math mode::        Thick, medium, thin and negative spaces.
* Math miscellany::             Stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Subscripts & superscripts,  Next: Math symbols,  Up: Math formulas

16.1 Subscripts & superscripts
==============================

In math mode, use the caret character '^' to make the EXP appear as a
superscript, ie. type '^{EXP}'.  Similarly, in math mode,
underscore '_{EXP}' makes a subscript out of EXP.

   In this example the '0' and '1' appear as subscripts while the '2' is
a superscript.

     \( (x_0+x_1)^2 \)

   To have more than one character in EXP use curly braces as in
'e^{-2x}'.

   LaTeX handles superscripts on superscripts, and all of that stuff, in
the natural way, so expressions such as 'e^{x^2}' and 'x_{a_0}' will
look right.  It also does the right thing when something has both a
subscript and a superscript.  In this example the '0' appears at the
bottom of the integral sign while the '10' appears at the top.

     \int_0^{10} x^2 \,dx

   You can put a superscript or subscript before a symbol with a
construct such as '{}_t K^2' in math mode (the initial '{}' prevents the
prefixed subscript from being attached to any prior symbols in the
expression).

   Outside of math mode, a construct like 'A
test$_\textnormal{subscript}$' will produce a subscript typeset in text
mode, not math mode.  Note that there are packages specialized for
writing Chemical formulas such as 'mhchem'.

16.2 Math symbols
=================

LaTeX provides almost any mathematical symbol you're likely to need.

symbol U+03C0.

exhaustive list.  Each symbol here is described with a short phrase, and
its symbol class (which determines the spacing around it) is given in
parenthesis.  The commands for these symbols can be used only in math

     '$f'''$' produces the the desired symbol, that is, the same result
     as '$f^{\prime\prime\prime}$', but uses somewhat less typing.  Note
     that you can only use '\prime' in math mode but you can type right

     vertical bar '\Vert'.  For such that, as in the definition of a
     set, use '\mid' because it is a relation.

     For absolute value you can use the 'mathtools' package and add
     '\DeclarePairedDelimiter\abs{\lvert}{\rvert}' to your preamble.
     This gives you three command variants for single-line vertical bars
     that are correctly horizontally spaced: if in the document body you
     write the starred version '$\abs*{\frac{22}{7}}$' then the height
     of the vertical bars will match the height of the argument, whereas
     with '\abs{\frac{22}{7}}' the bars do not grow with the height of
     the argument but instead are the default height, and '\abs[SIZE

16.5 Spacing in math mode
=========================

In a 'math' environment, LaTeX ignores the spaces that you use in the
source, and instead puts in the spacing according to the normal rules
for mathematics texts.

   Many math mode spacing definitions are expressed in terms of the math
unit "mu" given by 1 em = 18 mu, where the em is taken from the current
math symbols family (*note Units of length::).  LaTeX provides the
following commands for use in math mode:

'\;'
     Normally '5.0mu plus 5.0mu'.  The longer name is '\thickspace'.
     Math mode only.

'\:'
'\>'
     Normally '4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu'.  The longer name is
     '\medspace'.  Math mode only.

'\,'
     Normally '3mu'.  The longer name is '\thinspace'.  This can be used
     in both math mode and text mode.

'\!'
     A negative thin space.  Normally '-3mu'.  Math mode only.

'\quad'
     This is 18mu, that is, 1em.  This is often used for space
     surrounding equations or expressions, for instance for the space
     between two equations inside a 'displaymath' environment.  It is
     available in both text and math mode.

'\qquad'
     A length of 2 quads, that is, 36mu = 2em.  It is available in both
     text and math mode.

   In this example a thinspace separates the function from the
infinitesimal.

     \int_0^1 f(x)\,dx


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Math miscellany,  Prev: Spacing in math mode,  Up: Math formulas

16.6 Math miscellany
====================

'\*'
     A "discretionary" multiplication symbol, at which a line break is
     allowed.

'\cdots'
     A horizontal ellipsis with the dots raised to the center of the
     line.

'\ddots'
     A diagonal ellipsis: \ddots.

'\frac{num}{den}'
     Produces the fraction 'num' divided by 'den'.

'\left DELIM1 ... \right DELIM2'
     The two delimiters need not match; '.' acts as a null delimiter,
     producing no output.  The delimiters are sized according to the
     math in between.  Example: '\left( \sum_i=1^10 a_i \right]'.

'\overbrace{TEXT}'
     Generates a brace over TEXT.  For example,
     \overbrace{x+\cdots+x}^{k \rm\;times}.

'\overline{TEXT}'
     Generates a horizontal line over TEX.  For example, \overline{x+y}.

'\sqrt[ROOT]{arg}'
     Produces the representation of the square root of ARG.  The
     optional argument ROOT determines what root to produce.  For
     example, the cube root of 'x+y' would be typed as
     '$\sqrt[3]{x+y}$'.

'\stackrel{TEXT}{RELATION}'
     Puts TEXT above RELATION.  For example,
     '\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}'.

'\underbrace{math}'
     Generates MATH with a brace underneath.

'\underline{text}'
     Causes TEXT, which may be either math mode or not, to be
     underlined.  The line is always below the text, taking account of
     descenders.

'\vdots'
     Produces a vertical ellipsis.

17 Modes
********

When LaTeX is processing your input text, it is always in one of three
modes:

   * Paragraph mode
   * Math mode
   * Left-to-right mode, called LR mode for short

   Mode changes occur only when entering or leaving an environment, or
when LaTeX is processing the argument of certain text-producing
commands.

   "Paragraph mode" is the most common; it's the one LaTeX is in when
processing ordinary text.  In this mode, LaTeX breaks the input text
into lines and breaks the lines into pages.

   LaTeX is in "math mode" when it's generating a mathematical formula,
either displayed math or within a line.

   In "LR mode", as in paragraph mode, LaTeX considers the output that
it produces to be a string of words with spaces between them.  However,
unlike paragraph mode, LaTeX keeps going from left to right; it never
starts a new line in LR mode.  Even if you put a hundred words into an
'\mbox', LaTeX would keep typesetting them from left to right inside a
single box (and then most likely complain because the resulting box was
too wide to fit on the line).  LaTeX is in LR mode when it starts making
a box with an '\mbox' command.  You can get it to enter a different mode
inside the box--for example, you can make it enter math mode to put a
formula in the box.

   There are also several text-producing commands and environments for
making a box that put LaTeX into paragraph mode.  The box made by one of
these commands or environments will be called a 'parbox'.  When LaTeX is
in paragraph mode while making a box, it is said to be in "inner
paragraph mode" (no page breaks).  Its normal paragraph mode, which it
starts out in, is called "outer paragraph mode".

18 Page styles
**************

The '\documentclass' command determines the size and position of the
page's head and foot.  The page style determines what goes in them.

* Menu:

* \maketitle::          Generate a title page.
* \pagenumbering::      Set the style used for page numbers.
* \pagestyle::		Change the headings/footings style.
* \thispagestyle::      Change the headings/footings style for this page.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \maketitle,  Next: \pagenumbering,  Up: Page styles

18.1 '\maketitle'
=================

The '\maketitle' command generates a title on a separate title
page--except in the 'article' class, where the title is placed at the
top of the first page.  Information used to produce the title is
obtained from the following declarations:

'\author{NAME \and NAME2}'
     The '\author' command declares the document author(s), where the
     argument is a list of authors separated by '\and' commands.  Use
     '\\' to separate lines within a single author's entry--for example,
     to give the author's institution or address.

'\date{TEXT}'
     The '\date' command declares TEXT to be the document's date.  With
     no '\date' command, the current date (*note \today::) is used.

'\thanks{TEXT}'
     The '\thanks' command produces a '\footnote' to the title, usually
     used for credit acknowledgements.

'\title{TEXT}'
     The '\title' command declares TEXT to be the title of the document.
     Use '\\' to force a line break, as usual.

18.2 '\pagenumbering'
=====================

Synopsis:

     \pagenumbering{STYLE}

the page number to 1.  The STYLE argument is one of the following:

'arabic'
     arabic numerals

'roman'
     lowercase Roman numerals

'Roman'
     uppercase Roman numerals

'alph'
     lowercase letters

'Alph'
     uppercase letters

18.3 '\pagestyle'
=================

Synopsis:

     \pagestyle{STYLE}

   The '\pagestyle' command specifies how the headers and footers are
typeset from the current page onwards.  Values for STYLE:

'plain'
     Just a plain page number.

'empty'
     Empty headers and footers, e.g., no page numbers.

'headings'
     Put running headers on each page.  The document style specifies
     what goes in the headers.

'myheadings'
     Custom headers, specified via the '\markboth' or the '\markright'
     commands.

   Here are the descriptions of '\markboth' and '\markright':

'\markboth{LEFT}{RIGHT}'
     Sets both the left and the right heading.  A "left-hand heading"
     (LEFT) is generated by the last '\markboth' command before the end
     of the page, while a "right-hand heading" (RIGHT) is generated by
     the first '\markboth' or '\markright' that comes on the page if
     there is one, otherwise by the last one before the page.

'\markright{RIGHT}'
     Sets the right heading, leaving the left heading unchanged.

==============

Synopsis:

     \hspace{LENGTH}
     \hspace*{LENGTH}

   Add the horizontal space given by LENGTH.  The LENGTH is a rubber
length, that is, it may contain a 'plus' or 'minus' component, in any
unit that LaTeX understands (*note Lengths::).

   This command can add both positive and negative space; adding
negative space is like backspacing.

   Normally when TeX breaks a paragraph into lines it discards white
space (glues and kerns) that would come at the start of a line, so you
get an inter-word space or a line break between words but not both.
This command's starred version '\hspace*{...}' puts a non-discardable
invisible item in front of the space, so the space appears in the
output.

   This example make a one-line paragraph that puts 'Name:' an inch from
the right margin.

     \noindent\makebox[\linewidth]{\hspace{\fill}Name:\hspace{1in}}

19.2 '\hfill'
=============

Produce a rubber length which has no natural space but can stretch
horizontally as far as needed (*note Lengths::).

   The command '\hfill' is equivalent to '\hspace{\fill}'.  For space
that does not disappear at line breaks use '\hspace*{\fill}' instead
(*note \hspace::).

19.3 '\(SPACE)' and \@
======================

Mark a punctuation character, typically a period, as either ending a
sentence or as ending an abbreviation.

   By default, in justifying a line LaTeX adjusts the space after a
sentence-ending period (or a question mark, exclamation point, comma, or
colon) more than the space between words (*note \frenchspacing::).
LaTeX assumes that the period ends a sentence unless it is preceded by a
capital letter, in which case it takes that period for part of an
abbreviation.  Note that if a sentence-ending period is immediately
followed by a right parenthesis or bracket, or right single or double
quote, then the intersentence space follows that parenthesis or quote.

   If you have a period ending an abbreviation whose last letter is not
a capital letter, and that abbreviation is not the last word in the
sentence, then follow that period with a backslash-space ('\ ') or a tie
('~').  Examples are 'Nat.\ Acad.\ Science', and 'Mr.~Bean', and
'(manure, etc.)\ for sale'.

   For other use of '\ ', see also *note \(SPACE) after CS::.

   In the opposite situation, if you have a capital letter followed by a
period that ends the sentence, then put '\@' on the left of that period.
For example, 'book by the MAA\@.' will have intersentence spacing after
the period.

   In contrast, putting '\@' on the right of a period tells TeX that the
period does not end the sentence.  In the example 'reserved words (if,
then, etc.\@) are different', TeX will put interword space after the
closing parenthesis (note that '\@' is before the parenthesis).

19.4 '\ ' after a control sequence
==================================

The '\ ' command is often used after control sequences to keep them from
gobbling the space that follows, as in '\TeX\ is a nice system.' And,
under normal circumstances '\'<tab> and '\'<newline> are equivalent to
'\ '.  For other use of '\ ', see also *note \(SPACE) and \@::.

   Some people prefer to use '{}' for the same purpose, as in '\TeX{} is
a nice system.' This has the advantage that you can always write it the
same way, like '\TeX{}', whether it is followed by a space or by a
punctuation mark.  Please compare:

     \TeX\ is a nice system. \TeX, a nice system.

     \TeX{} is a nice system. \TeX{}, a nice system.

   When you define user commands (*note \newcommand & \renewcommand::)
you can prevent the space gobbling after the command by using the
package 'xspace' and inserting '\xspace' at the end of the definition
For instance:
     \documentclass{minimal}
     \usepackage{xspace}
     \newcommand*{\Loup}{Grand Cric\xspace}
     \begin{document}
     Que le \Loup me croque !
     \end{document}

   A quick hack to use '\xspace' for existing command is as follows:
     \documentclass{minimal}
     \usepackage{xspace}
     \newcommand*{\SansXspaceTeX}{}
     \let\SansXspaceTeX\TeX
     \renewcommand{\TeX}{\SansXspaceTeX\xspace}
     \begin{document}
     \TeX is a nice system.
     \end{document}

19.5 '\frenchspacing'
=====================

This declaration (from Plain TeX) causes LaTeX to treat intersentence
spacing in the same way as interword spacing.

   In justifying the text in a line, some typographic traditions,
including English, prefer to adjust the space between sentences (or
after other punctuation marks) more than the space between words.
Following this declaration, all spaces are instead treated equally.

   Revert to the default behavior by declaring '\nonfrenchspacing'.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \thinspace,  Next: \/,  Prev: \frenchspacing,  Up: Spaces

19.6 '\thinspace': Insert 1/6em
===============================

'\thinspace' produces an unbreakable and unstretchable space that is 1/6
of an em.  This is the proper space to use between nested quotes, as in
'".


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \/,  Next: \hrulefill \dotfill,  Prev: \thinspace,  Up: Spaces

19.7 '\/': Insert italic correction
===================================

The '\/' command produces an "italic correction".  This is a small space
defined by the font designer for a given character, to avoid the
character colliding with whatever follows.  The italic f character
typically has a large italic correction value.

   If the following character is a period or comma, it's not necessary
to insert an italic correction, since those punctuation symbols have a
very small height.  However, with semicolons or colons, as well as
normal letters, it can help.  Compare f: f; (in the TeX output, the 'f's
are nicely separated) with f: f;.

   When changing fonts with commands such as '\textit{italic text}' or
'{\itshape italic text}', LaTeX will automatically insert an italic
correction if appropriate (*note Font styles::).

   Despite the name, roman characters can also have an italic
correction.  Compare pdfTeX (in the TeX output, there is a small space
after the 'f') with pdfTeX.

   There is no concept of italic correction in math mode; spacing is
done in a different way.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \hrulefill \dotfill,  Next: \addvspace,  Prev: \/,  Up: Spaces

19.8 '\hrulefill \dotfill'
==========================

Produce an infinite rubber length (*note Lengths::) filled with a
horizontal rule (that is, a line) or with dots, instead of just white
space.

   When placed between blank lines this example creates a paragraph that
is left and right justified, where the space in the middle is filled
with evenly spaced dots.

     \noindent Jack Aubrey\dotfill Melbury Lodge

   To make the rule or dots go to the line's end use '\null' at the
start or end.

   To change the rule's thickness, copy the definition and adjust it, as
with '\renewcommand{\hrulefill}{\leavevmode\leaders\hrule height
1pt\hfill\kern\z@}', which changes the default thickness of 0.4pt to
1pt.  Similarly, adjust the dot spacing as with
'\renewcommand{\dotfill}{\leavevmode\cleaders\hb@xt@ 1.00em{\hss .\hss
}\hfill\kern\z@}', which changes the default length of 0.33em to 1.00em.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addvspace,  Next: \bigskip \medskip \smallskip,  Prev: \hrulefill \dotfill,  Up: Spaces

19.9 '\addvspace'
=================

'\addvspace{LENGTH}'

   Add a vertical space of height LENGTH, which is a rubber length
(*note Lengths::).  However, if vertical space has already been added to
the same point in the output by a previous '\addvspace' command then
this command will not add more space than what is needed to make the
natural length of the total vertical space equal to LENGTH.

   Use this command to adjust the vertical space above or below an
environment that starts a new paragraph.  For instance, a Theorem
environment is defined to begin and end with '\addvspace{...}' so that
two consecutive Theorem's are separated by one vertical space, not two.

   This command is fragile (*note \protect::).

   The error 'Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item' means that you
were not in vertical mode when you invoked this command; one way to
change that is to precede this command with a '\par' command.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \bigskip \medskip \smallskip,  Next: \vfill,  Prev: \addvspace,  Up: Spaces

19.10 '\bigskip \medskip \smallskip'
====================================

These commands produce a given amount of space, specified by the
document class.

'\bigskip'
     The same as '\vspace{\bigskipamount}', ordinarily about one line
     space, with stretch and shrink (the default for the 'book' and
     'article' classes is '12pt plus 4pt minus 4pt').

'\medskip'
     The same as '\vspace{\medskipamount}', ordinarily about half of a
     line space, with stretch and shrink (the default for the 'book' and
     'article' classes is '6pt plus 2pt minus 2pt').

'\smallskip'
     The same as '\vspace{\smallskipamount}', ordinarily about a quarter
     of a line space, with stretch and shrink (the default for the
     'book' and 'article' classes is '3pt plus 1pt minus 1pt').


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \vfill,  Next: \vspace,  Prev: \bigskip \medskip \smallskip,  Up: Spaces

19.11 '\vfill'
==============

End the current paragraph and insert a vertical rubber length (*note
Lengths::) that is infinite, so it can stretch or shrink as far as
needed.

   It is often used in the same way as '\vspace{\fill}', except that
'\vfill' ends the current paragraph, whereas '\vspace{\fill}' adds the
infinite vertical space below its line irrespective of the paragraph
structure.  In both cases that space will disappear at a page boundary;
to circumvent this see *note \vspace::.

   In this example the page is filled, so the top and bottom lines
contain the text 'Lost Dog!' and the third 'Lost Dog!' is exactly
halfway between them.

     \begin{document}
     Lost Dog!
     \vfill
     Lost Dog!
     \vfill
     Lost Dog!
     \end{document}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \vspace,  Prev: \vfill,  Up: Spaces

19.12 '\vspace{LENGTH}'
=======================

Synopsis, one of these two:

     \vspace{LENGTH}
     \vspace*{LENGTH}

   Add the vertical space LENGTH.  This can be negative or positive, and
is a rubber length (*note Lengths::).

   LaTeX removes the vertical space from '\vspace' at a page break, that
is, at the top or bottom of a page.  The starred version '\vspace*{...}'
causes the space to stay.

   If '\vspace' is used in the middle of a paragraph (i.e., in
horizontal mode), the space is inserted _after_ the line with the
'\vspace' command.  A new paragraph is not started.

   In this example the two questions will be evenly spaced vertically on
the page, with at least one inch of space below each.

     \begin{document}
     1) Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?
     \vspace{1in plus 1fill}

     2) Who put the ram in the rama lama ding dong?
     \vspace{1in plus 1fill}

20.1 '\mbox{TEXT}'
==================

The '\mbox' command creates a box just wide enough to hold the text
created by its argument.  The TEXT is not broken into lines, so it can
be used to prevent hyphenation.

20.2 '\fbox' and '\framebox'
============================

Synopses:

     \fbox{TEXT}
     \framebox[WIDTH][POSITION]{TEXT}

   The '\fbox' and '\framebox' commands are like '\mbox', except that
they put a frame around the outside of the box being created.

   In addition, the '\framebox' command allows for explicit
specification of the box width with the optional WIDTH argument (a
dimension), and positioning with the optional POSITION argument.

   Both commands produce a rule of thickness '\fboxrule' (default
'.4pt'), and leave a space of '\fboxsep' (default '3pt') between the
rule and the contents of the box.

   *Note \framebox (picture)::, for the '\framebox' command in the
'picture' environment.

   The text inside the environment is saved in the box 'cmd', which must
have been declared with '\newsavebox'.

20.4 '\makebox'
===============

Synopsis:

     \makebox[WIDTH][POSITION]{TEXT}

   The '\makebox' command creates a box just wide enough to contain the
TEXT specified.  The width of the box can be overridden by the optional
WIDTH argument.  The position of the text within the box is determined
by the optional POSITION argument, which may take the following values:

'c'
     Centered (default).
'l'
     Flush left.
'r'
     Flush right.
's'
     Stretch (justify) across entire WIDTH; TEXT must contain
     stretchable space for this to work.

   '\makebox' is also used within the 'picture' environment *note
\makebox (picture)::.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \parbox,  Next: \raisebox,  Prev: \makebox,  Up: Boxes

20.5 '\parbox'
==============

Synopsis:

     \parbox[POSITION][HEIGHT][INNER-POS]{WIDTH}{TEXT}

   The '\parbox' command produces a box whose contents are created in
'paragraph' mode.  It should be used to make a box small pieces of text,
with nothing fancy inside.  In particular, you shouldn't use any
paragraph-making environments inside a '\parbox' argument.  For larger
pieces of text, including ones containing a paragraph-making
environment, you should use a 'minipage' environment (*note minipage::).

   '\parbox' has two mandatory arguments:

WIDTH
     the width of the parbox;
TEXT
     the text that goes inside the parbox.

   By default LaTeX will position vertically a parbox so its center
lines up with the center of the surrounding text line.  When the
optional POSITION argument is present and equal either to 't' or 'b',
this allows you respectively to align either the top or bottom line in
the parbox with the baseline of the surrounding text.  You may also
specify 'm' for POSITION to get the default behaviour.

   The optional HEIGHT argument overrides the natural height of the box.

   The INNER-POS argument controls the placement of the text inside the
box, as follows; if it is not specified, POSITION is used.

't'
     text is placed at the top of the box.
'c'
     text is centered in the box.
'b'
     text is placed at the bottom of the box.
's'
     stretch vertically; the text must contain vertically stretchable
     space for this to work.

20.6 '\raisebox'
================

Synopsis:

     \raisebox{distance}[HEIGHT][DEPTH]{text}

   The '\raisebox' command raises or lowers TEXT.  The first mandatory
argument specifies how high TEXT is to be raised (or lowered if it is a
negative amount).  TEXT itself is processed in LR mode.

   The optional arguments HEIGHT and DEPTH are dimensions.  If they are
specified, LaTeX treats TEXT as extending a certain distance above the
baseline (height) or below (depth), ignoring its natural height and
depth.

   This command typeset TEXT in a box just as with '\makebox' (*note
\makebox::), except that instead of printing the resulting box, it saves
it in the box labeled \BOXCMD, which must have been declared with
'\newsavebox' (*note \newsavebox::).

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Reserved characters,  Next: Symbols by font position,  Up: Special insertions

21.1 Reserved characters
========================

LaTeX sets aside the following characters for special purposes (for
example, the percent sign '%' is for comments) so they are called
"reserved characters" or "special characters".

     # $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \

   If you want a reserved character to be printed as itself, in the text
body font, for all but the final three characters in that list simply
put a backslash '\' in front of the character.  Thus, '\$1.23' will
produce '$1.23' in your output.

   As to the last three characters, to get a tilde in the text body font
use '\~{}' (omitting the curly braces would result in the next character
receiving a tilde accent).  Similarly, to get a get a text body font
circumflex use '\^{}'.  A text body font backslash results from
'\textbackslash{}'.

   To produce the reserved characters in a typewriter font use
'\verb!!', as below.

     \begin{center}
       \# \$ \% \& \{ \} \_ \~{} \^{} \textbackslash \\
       \verb!# $ % & { } _ ~ ^ \!
     \end{center}

   In that example the double backslash '\\' is only there to split the
lines.

21.2 Symbols by font position
=============================

You can access any character of the current font using its number with
the '\symbol' command.  For example, the visible space character used in
the '\verb*' command has the code decimal 32, so it can be typed as
'\symbol{32}'.

   You can also specify numbers in octal (base 8) by using a ''' prefix,
or hexadecimal (base 16) with a '"' prefix, so the previous example
could also be written as '\symbol{'40}' or '\symbol{"20}'.

21.4 Accents
============

LaTeX has wide support for many of the world's scripts and languages,
through the 'babel' package and related support.  This section does not
attempt to cover all that support.  It merely lists the core LaTeX
commands for creating accented characters.

   The '\capital...' commands produce alternative forms for use with
capital letters.  These are not available with OT1.

'\"'
'\capitaldieresis'
     Produces an umlaut (dieresis), as in o".

'\''
'\capitalacute'
     Produces an acute accent, as in o'.  In the 'tabbing' environment,
     pushes current column to the right of the previous column (*note
     tabbing::).

'\.'
     Produces a dot accent over the following, as in o..

'\='
'\capitalmacron'
     Produces a macron (overbar) accent over the following, as in o=.

'\^'
'\capitalcircumflex'
     Produces a circumflex (hat) accent over the following, as in o^.

'\`'
'\capitalgrave'
     Produces a grave accent over the following, as in o`.  In the
     'tabbing' environment, move following text to the right margin
     (*note tabbing::).

'\~'
'\capitaltilde'
     Produces a tilde accent over the following, as in n~.

     Produces a bar accent under the following, as in o_.  See also
     '\underbar' hereinafter.

'\c'
'\capitalcedilla'
     Produces a cedilla accent under the following, as in c,.

'\d'
'\capitaldotaccent'
     Produces a dot accent under the following, as in .o.

     Produces a long Hungarian umlaut accent over the following, as in
     o''.

'\i'
     Produces a dotless i, as in 'i'.

'\j'
     Produces a dotless j, as in 'j'.

'\k'
'\capitalogonek'
     Produces a letter with ogonek, as in 'o;'.  Not available in the
     OT1 encoding.

'\r'
'\capitalring'
     Produces a ring accent, as in 'o*'.

'\t'
'\capitaltie'
'\newtie'
'\capitalnewtie'
     Produces a tie-after accent, as in 'oo['.  The '\newtie' form is
     centered in its box.

'\u'
'\capitalbreve'
     Produces a breve accent, as in 'o('.

'\underbar'
     Not exactly an accent, this produces a bar under the argument text.
     The argument is always processed in horizontal mode.  The bar is
     always a fixed position under the baseline, thus crossing through
     descenders.  See also '\underline' in *note Math miscellany::.  See
     also '\b' above.

'\v'
'\capitalcaron'
     Produces a ha'c<ek (check, caron) accent, as in 'o<'.

21.6 '\rule'
============

Synopsis:

     \rule[RAISE]{WIDTH}{THICKNESS}

   The '\rule' command produces "rules", that is, lines or rectangles.
The arguments are:

RAISE
     How high to raise the rule (optional).

WIDTH
     The length of the rule (mandatory).

THICKNESS
     The thickness of the rule (mandatory).

21.7 '\today'
=============

The '\today' command produces today's date, in the format 'MONTH DD,
YYYY'; for example, 'July 4, 1976'.  It uses the predefined counters
'\day', '\month', and '\year' (*note \day \month \year::) to do this.
It is not updated as the program runs.

   The 'datetime' package, among others, can produce a wide variety of
other date formats.

22 Splitting the input
**********************

A large document requires a lot of input.  Rather than putting the whole
input in a single large file, it's more efficient to split it into
several smaller ones.  Regardless of how many separate files you use,
there is one that is the root file; it is the one whose name you type
when you run LaTeX.

   *Note filecontents::, for an environment that allows bundling an
external file to be created with the main document.

* Menu:

* \include::            Conditionally include a file.
* \includeonly::        Determine which files are included.
* \input::              Unconditionally include a file.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \include,  Next: \includeonly,  Up: Splitting the input

22.1 '\include'
===============

Synopsis:

     \include{FILE}

   If no '\includeonly' command is present, the '\include' command
executes '\clearpage' to start a new page (*note \clearpage::), then
reads FILE, then does another '\clearpage'.

   Given an '\includeonly' command, the '\include' actions are only run
if FILE is listed as an argument to '\includeonly'.  See the next
section.

   The '\include' command may not appear in the preamble or in a file
read by another '\include' command.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \includeonly,  Next: \input,  Prev: \include,  Up: Splitting the input

22.2 \'includeonly'
===================

Synopsis:

     \includeonly{FILE1,FILE2,...}

   The '\includeonly' command controls which files will be read by
subsequent '\include' commands.  The list of filenames is
comma-separated.  Each FILE must exactly match a filename specified in a
'\include' command for the selection to be effective.

   This command can only appear in the preamble.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \input,  Prev: \includeonly,  Up: Splitting the input

22.3 '\input'
=============

Synopsis:

     \input{FILE}

   The '\input' command causes the specified FILE to be read and
processed, as if its contents had been inserted in the current file at
that point.

   If FILE does not end in '.tex' (e.g., 'foo' or 'foo.bar'), it is
first tried with that extension ('foo.tex' or 'foo.bar.tex').  If that
is not found, the original FILE is tried ('foo' or 'foo.bar').

File: latex2e.info,  Node: Tables of contents,  Next: Glossaries,  Up: Front/back matter

23.1 Tables of contents
=======================

A table of contents is produced with the '\tableofcontents' command.
You put the command right where you want the table of contents to go;
LaTeX does the rest for you.  A previous run must have generated a
'.toc' file.

   The '\tableofcontents' command produces a heading, but it does not
automatically start a new page.  If you want a new page after the table
of contents, write a '\newpage' command after the '\tableofcontents'
command.

   The analogous commands '\listoffigures' and '\listoftables' produce a
list of figures and a list of tables (from '.lof' and '.lot' files),
respectively.  Everything works exactly the same as for the table of
contents.

   The command '\nofiles' overrides these commands, and _prevents_ any
of these lists from being generated.

* Menu:

* \addcontentsline::    Add an entry to table of contents, etc.
* \addtocontents::      Add text directly to table of contents file, etc.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addcontentsline,  Next: \addtocontents,  Up: Tables of contents

23.1.1 '\addcontentsline'
-------------------------

The '\addcontentsline'{EXT}{UNIT}{TEXT} command adds an entry to the
specified list or table where:

EXT
     The extension of the file on which information is to be written,
     typically one of: 'toc' (table of contents), 'lof' (list of
     figures), or 'lot' (list of tables).

UNIT
     The name of the sectional unit being added, typically one of the
     following, matching the value of the EXT argument:

     'toc'
          The name of the sectional unit: 'part', 'chapter', 'section',
          'subsection', 'subsubsection'.
     'lof'
          For the list of figures.
     'lot'
          For the list of tables.

ENTRY
     The text of the entry.

   What is written to the '.EXT' file is the command
'\contentsline{UNIT}{NAME}'.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \addtocontents,  Prev: \addcontentsline,  Up: Tables of contents

23.1.2 '\addtocontents'
-----------------------

The '\addtocontents'{EXT}{TEXT} command adds text (or formatting
commands) directly to the '.EXT' file that generates the table of
contents or lists of figures or tables.

EXT
     The extension of the file on which information is to be written,
     typically one of: 'toc' (table of contents), 'lof' (list of
     figures), or 'lot' (list of tables).

TEXT
     The text to be written.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Glossaries,  Next: Indexes,  Prev: Tables of contents,  Up: Front/back matter

23.2 Glossaries
===============

The command '\makeglossary' enables creating glossaries.

   The command '\glossary{TEXT}' writes a glossary entry for TEXT to an
auxiliary file with the '.glo' extension.

   Specifically, what gets written is the command
'\glossaryentry{TEXT}{PAGENO}', where PAGENO is the current '\thepage'
value.

   The 'glossary' package on CTAN provides support for fancier
glossaries.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Indexes,  Prev: Glossaries,  Up: Front/back matter

23.3 Indexes
============

The command '\makeindex' enables creating indexes.  Put this in the
preamble.

   The command '\index{TEXT}' writes an index entry for TEXT to an
auxiliary file with the '.idx' extension.

   Specifically, what gets written is the command
'\indexentry{TEXT}{PAGENO}', where PAGENO is the current '\thepage'
value.

   To generate a index entry for 'bar' that says 'See foo', use a
vertical bar: '\index{bar|see{foo}}'.  Use 'seealso' instead of 'see' to
make a 'See also' entry.

   The text 'See' is defined by the macro '\seename', and 'See also' by
the macro '\alsoname'.  These can be redefined for other languages.

   The generated '.idx' file is then sorted with an external command,
usually either 'makeindex' (<http://mirror.ctan.org/indexing/makeindex>)
or (the multi-lingual) 'xindy' (<http://xindy.sourceforge.net>).  This
results in a '.ind' file, which can then be read to typeset the index.

   The index is usually generated with the '\printindex' command.  This
is defined in the 'makeidx' package, so '\usepackage{makeidx}' needs to
be in the preamble.

   The rubber length '\indexspace' is inserted before each new letter in
the printed index; its default value is '10pt plus5pt minus3pt'.

   The 'showidx' package causes each index entries to be shown in the
margin on the page where the entry appears.  This can help in preparing
the index.

   The 'multind' package supports multiple indexes.  See also the TeX
FAQ entry on this topic,
<http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=multind>.

24 Letters
**********

Synopsis:

     \documentclass{letter}
     \address{SENDER ADDRESS}
     \signature{SENDER NAME}
     \begin{document}
     \begin{letter}{RECIPIENT ADDRESS}
     \opening{SALUTATION}
       LETTER BODY
     \closing{CLOSING TEXT}
     \end{letter}
       ...  more letters ...
     \end{document}

   Produce one or more letters.

   Each letter is in a separate 'letter' environment, whose argument
RECIPIENT ADDRESS often contains multiple lines separated with a double
backslash ('\\').  For example, you might have:

      \begin{letter}{Mr. Joe Smith \\
           2345 Princess St. \\
           Edinburgh, EH1 1AA}
        ...
      \end{letter}

   The start of the 'letter' environment resets the page number to 1,
and the footnote number to 1 also.

   The SENDER ADDRESS and SENDER NAME are common to all of the letters,
whether there is one or more, so these are best put in the preamble.  As
with the recipient address, often SENDER ADDRESS contains multiple lines
separated by a double backslash ('\\').  LaTeX will put the SENDER NAME
under the closing, after a vertical space for the traditional
hand-written signature; it also can contain multiple lines.

   Each letter environment begins with a required '\opening' command
such as '\opening{Dear Madam or Sir:}'.  The LETTER BODY text is
ordinary LaTeX so it can contain everything from from enumerated lists
to displayed math, except that commands such as '\chapter' that make no
sense in a letter are turned off.  Each letter environment typically
ends with a '\closing' command such as '\closing{Yours,}'.

   Additional material may come after the '\closing'.  You can say who
is receiving a copy of the letter with a command like '\cc{the Boss \\
the Boss's Boss}'.  There's a similar '\encl' command for a list of
enclosures.  And, you can add a postscript with '\ps'.

   LaTeX's default is to indent the signature and the '\closing' above
it by a length of '\longindentation'.  By default this is
'0.5\textwidth'.  To make them flush left, put
'\setlength{\longindentation}{0em}' in your preamble.

   To set a fixed date use something like
'\renewcommand{\today}{2015-Oct-12}'.  If put in your preamble then it
will apply to all the letters.

   This example shows only one 'letter' environment.  The three lines
marked as optional are typically omitted.

     \documentclass{letter}
     \address{Sender's street \\ Sender's town}
     \signature{Sender's name \\ Sender's title}
     % optional: \location{Mailbox 13}
     % optional: \telephone{(102) 555-0101}
     \begin{document}
     \begin{letter}{Recipient's name \\ Recipient's address}
     \opening{Sir:}
     % optional: \thispagestyle{firstpage}
     I am not interested in entering a business arrangement with you.
     \closing{Your most humble, etc.,}
     \end{letter}
     \end{document}

   These commands are used with the 'letter' class.

File: latex2e.info,  Node: \address,  Next: \cc,  Up: Letters

24.1 '\address'
===============

Synopsis:

     \address{SENDERS ADDRESS}

   Specifies the return address as it appears on the letter and on the
envelope.  Separate multiple lines in SENDERS ADDRESS with a double
backslash '\\'.

   Because it can apply to multiple letters this declaration is often
put in the preamble.  However, it can go anywhere, including inside an
individual 'letter' environment.

   This command is optional: without the '\address' declaration the
letter is formatted with some blank space on top, for copying onto
pre-printed letterhead paper.  (*Note Overview::, for details on your
local implementation.)  With the '\address' declaration, it is formatted
as a personal letter.

   Here is an example.

     \address{Stephen Maturin \\
              The Grapes of the Savoy}

24.2 '\cc'
==========

Synopsis:

     \cc{FIRST NAME \\
         .. }

   Produce a list of names to which copies of the letter were sent.
This command is optional.  If it appears then typically it comes after
'\closing'.  Separate multiple lines with a double backslash '\\'.

     \cc{President \\
         Vice President}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \closing,  Next: \encl,  Prev: \cc,  Up: Letters

24.3 '\closing'
===============

Synopsis:

     \closing{text}

   Usually at the end of a letter, above the handwritten signature,
there is a '\closing' (although this command is optional).  For example,

     \closing{Regards,}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \encl,  Next: \location,  Prev: \closing,  Up: Letters

24.4 '\encl'
============

Synopsis:

     \encl{FIRST ENCLOSED OBJECT \\
           .. }

   Produce a list of things included with the letter.  This command is
optional; when it is used, it typically is put after '\closing'.
Separate multiple lines with a double backslash '\\'.

     \encl{License \\
            Passport }


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \location,  Next: \makelabels,  Prev: \encl,  Up: Letters

24.5 '\location'
================

Synopsis:

     \location{TEXT}

   The TEXT appears centered at the bottom of the each page.  It only
appears if the page style is 'firstpage'.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \makelabels,  Next: \name,  Prev: \location,  Up: Letters

24.6 '\makelabels'
==================

Synopsis:

     \makelabels

   Create a sheet of address labels from the recipient addresses, one
for each letter.  This sheet will be output before the letters, with the
idea that you can copy it to a sheet of peel-off labels.  This command
goes in the preamble.

   Customize the labels by redefining the commands '\startlabels',
'\mlabel', and '\returnaddress' in the preamble.  The command
'\startlabels' sets the width, height, number of columns, etc., of the
page onto which the labels are printed.  The command '\mlabel{SENDER
ADDRESS}{RECIPIENT ADDRESS}' produces the two labels (or one, if you
choose to ignore the SENDER ADDRESS).  The SENDER ADDRESS is the value
returned by the macro '\returnaddress' while RECIPIENT ADDRESS is the
value passed in the argument to the 'letter' environment.  By default
'\mlabel' ignores the first argument, the SENDER ADDRESS.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \name,  Next: \opening,  Prev: \makelabels,  Up: Letters

24.7 '\name'
============

Synopsis:

     \name{NAME}

   Sender's name, used for printing on the envelope together with the
return address.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \opening,  Next: \ps,  Prev: \name,  Up: Letters

24.8 '\opening'
===============

Synopsis:

     \opening{TEXT}

   This command is required.  It starts a letter, following the
'\begin{letter}{...}'.  The mandatory argument TEXT is the text that
starts your letter.  For instance:

     \opening{Dear John:}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \ps,  Next: \signature,  Prev: \opening,  Up: Letters

24.9 '\ps'
==========

Synopsis:

     \ps{TEXT}

   Add a postscript.  This command is optional and usually is used after
'\closing'.

     \ps{P.S.  After you have read this letter, burn it. Or eat it.}


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \signature,  Next: \telephone,  Prev: \ps,  Up: Letters

24.10 '\signature'
==================

Synopsis:

     \signature{FIRST LINE \\
                 .. }

   The sender's name.  This command is optional, although its inclusion
is usual.

   The argument text appears at the end of the letter, after the closing
and after a vertical space for the traditional hand-written signature.
Separate multiple lines with a double backslash '\\'.  For example:

     \signature{J Fred Muggs \\
                White House}

   LaTeX's default for the vertical space from the '\closing' text down
to the '\signature' text is '6\medskipamount', which is six times 0.7em.

   This command is usually in the preamble, to apply to all the letters
in the document.  To have it apply to one letter only, put it inside a
'letter' environment and before the '\closing'.

   You can include a graphic in the signature, for instance with
'\signature{\vspace{-6\medskipamount}\includegraphics{sig.png}\\ My
name}' (this requires writing '\usepackage{graphicx}' in the preamble).


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \telephone,  Prev: \signature,  Up: Letters

24.11 '\telephone'
==================

Synopsis:

     \telephone{NUMBER}

   The sender's telephone number.  This is typically in the preamble,
where it applies to all letters.  This only appears if the 'firstpage'
pagestyle is selected.  If so, it appears on the lower right of the
page.

25.1 '\typein[CMD]{MSG}'
========================

Synopsis:

     \typein[\CMD]{MSG}

   '\typein' prints MSG on the terminal and causes LaTeX to stop and
wait for you to type a line of input, ending with return.  If the
optional \CMD argument is omitted, the typed input is processed as if it
had been included in the input file in place of the '\typein' command.
If the \CMD argument is present, it must be a command name.  This
command name is then defined or redefined to be the typed input.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: \typeout,  Prev: \typein,  Up: Terminal input/output

25.2 '\typeout{MSG}'
====================

Synopsis:

     \typeout{MSG}

   Prints 'msg' on the terminal and in the 'log' file.  Commands in
'msg' that are defined with '\newcommand' or '\renewcommand' (among
others) are replaced by their definitions before being printed.

   LaTeX's usual rules for treating multiple spaces as a single space
and ignoring spaces after a command name apply to 'msg'.  A '\space'
command in 'msg' causes a single space to be printed, independent of
surrounding spaces.  A '^^J' in 'msg' prints a newline.


File: latex2e.info,  Node: Command line,  Next: Document templates,  Prev: Terminal input/output,  Up: Top

26 Command line
***************

The input file specification indicates the file to be formatted; TeX
uses '.tex' as a default file extension.  If you omit the input file
entirely, TeX accepts input from the terminal.  You can also specify
arbitrary LaTeX input by starting with a backslash.  For example, this
processes 'foo.tex' without pausing after every error:

     latex '\nonstopmode\input foo.tex'

   With many, but not all, implementations, command-line options can
also be specified in the usual Unix way, starting with '-' or '--'.  For
a list of those options, try 'latex --help'.

   If LaTeX stops in the middle of the document and gives you a '*'
prompt, it is waiting for input.  You can type '\stop' (and return) and
it will prematurely end the document.
